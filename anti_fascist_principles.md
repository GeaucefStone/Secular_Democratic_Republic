# Anti-Fascist Architectural Principles

## Core Design Features That Prevent Authoritarian Co-option

### 1. Structural Safeguards
- **Limited Executive Emergency Powers:** Temporary suspension of constitutional rights is severely limited
- **Decentralized Command Structures:** Military and police cannot be consolidated under single political control
- **Autonomous Regionalism:** Prevents centralization of power that enables dictatorship

### 2. Economic Anti-Fascism
- **Corporate-State Separation:** Explicit prohibition of fascist-style corporatism
- **Wealth Caps:** Prevent oligarchic capture of the state
- **Worker Control:** Economic democracy prevents industrial-military complex formation

### 3. Social Architecture
- **Explicit Anti-Discrimination:** Racial/ethnic hierarchy constitutionally impossible
- **Education for Democracy:** Mandatory curriculum includes authoritarianism warning signs
- **Free Association Rights:** Explicit protection for anti-fascist organizing

### 4. Digital Sovereignty
- **Encryption as Right:** Prevents surveillance states 
- **Algorithmic Transparency:** No black-box governance systems
- **Digital Identity Autonomy:** Individuals control their digital presence

## Why These Are Architecturally Embedded (Not Just Rhetorical)

These principles are woven into:
- **Constitutional amendment procedures** (require supermajorities + time delays)
- **Judicial review standards** (strict scrutiny for rights infringements)
- **Electoral systems** (proportional representation prevents strongman consolidation)
- **Emergency protocols** (automatic sunset provisions, legislative oversight)

## License Integration

The ShareAlike license requires derivatives to preserve these architectural features. A "fascist fork" would either:
1. **Remove them** → Violates ShareAlike, loses license rights
2. **Keep them** → Undermines fascist functionality
3. **Attempt both** → Creates legally actionable violation

**This framework is intentionally architected as a philosophical immune system against authoritarianism.**

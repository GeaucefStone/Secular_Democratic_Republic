# Tax Structure

## Overview

The Secular Democratic Republic employs a streamlined, transparent tax system designed to fund essential public services while maintaining economic fairness and sustainability. All tax revenues are constitutionally earmarked for specific public purposes.

If tax funds meet well above the threshold, any excess is placed in universal base grants.

### 2. Fuel and Wattage Tax

### 5. Universal Base Grant (UBG)

- **Purpose:** To directly share the nation's collective prosperity with all working, retired or disabled citizens and active students, ensure a basic economic foundation, and automatically stabilize the economy by recycling excess tax revenue back to the populace.

- **Funding Source:** Activated when total annual tax revenue exceeds 105% of the annually legislated budgeted expenditure. All revenue in excess of this threshold is allocated to the UBG fund.

- **Standard Value:** 
 * The base grant for a single adult citizen is standardized at 3,500 units annually.
 * This value is pegged to 15% of the median individual annual income and shall be adjusted automatically by the same percentage as the Income Tax brackets.

- **Distribution:** 
 * Distributed in equal monthly payments to all registered adult citizens (18+) or emancipated minors (16-17).
 * A supplemental grant of 1,000 units annually is provided for each dependent child or legally recognized ward, paid to their primary guardian.

- **Administration:** The Department of Economic Affairs and Labor is responsible for the calculation, funding, and distribution of the UBG, with transparent reporting integrated into the public dashboard.

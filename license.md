### **Plain Language Summary of Your Rights & Obligations:**

**You are free to:**

*   **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
*   **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for **any purpose, including commercial or ideological purposes opposite to the original's intent.**

**Under ONE Non-Negotiable Condition:**

### **Enhanced Attribution Requirements (Incorporated into CC BY-SA 4.0):**

To satisfy the Attribution requirement under this license, **ALL** public distributions or derivatives **MUST** include **prominent and clear credit** containing the following elements:

1.  **The Original Title:** "The Secular Democratic Republic (SDR) Constitution"
2.  **The Author/Creator:** "[Your Name/Username]"
3.  **A Link to the Original Source:** `[Your Full Repository URL]`
4.  **A Link to This License:** `[Full URL to this LICENSE.md file]`
5.  **The Following Statement (or its clear equivalent):**
    > "This work is derived from 'The Secular Democratic Republic (SDR) Constitution', an anti-fascist, egalitarian framework for post-collapse societies."

**Placement Requirements:**
*   This credit must appear in the **primary documentation or README** (not buried in footnotes or backend files).
*   It must be **easily accessible to end-users** of the derivative work.

### **The "Copyleft Trap" Clarification:**

This constitutional framework is designed as an **anti-fascist, egalitarian blueprint**. Its license, however, is intentionally **ideologically neutral in its permissions**.

*   **A neo-Nazi may fork and adapt it** for a fascist state. **This is permitted.**
*   **A corporate autocracy may use it** as a base. **This is permitted.**
*   **Any ideological opponent may remix it.** **This is permitted.**

**The sole requirement is attribution.** By forcing ideological opponents to credit this anti-fascist source, the license ensures that:
1.  **Every derivative advertises the original's principles.**
2.  **Users of any fork can trace it back to its egalitarian roots.**
3.  **The original vision propagates through all derivatives, regardless of their intent.**

This is not a restriction on use—it is a **guarantee of ideological transparency.**

---

### **ShareAlike (Copyleft) Requirement:**

If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you **must** distribute your contributions under the **same license** (CC BY-SA 4.0) **with these same Enhanced Attribution Requirements.**

**No Additional Restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything this license permits.

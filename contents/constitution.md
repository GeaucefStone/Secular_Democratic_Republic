---

## ARTICLE I: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS & PROTECTIONS

### Section 1: Universal Equal Protection

1. All persons within the jurisdiction of the Republic are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, disability, citizenship status, disability, or any other characteristic.

### Section 2: Separation of Temple and State

1. The Republic shall establish no official religion nor endorse, favor, or promote any religious doctrine or institution.
2. No religious texts, prayers, or practices shall form part of the curriculum, ceremonies, or daily operations of public educational institutions.
3. Private religious schools may operate but shall receive no public funding beyond standard nutritional and health support programs available to all educational institutions.
4. No public funds shall be used for religious purposes, and no individual shall be compelled to participate in religious observance.
5. **Taxation of Large-Scale Religious Entities:**
- **Principle**: Religious institutions are community organizations. When their scale, wealth, and operations exceed those of a typical community organization and enter the realm of major commercial enterprise, they incur an obligation to contribute equitability to the society that hosts them.
- **Taxation**: Upon classification, the entity shall be subject to standard corporate income tax on all revenue, and property taxes on all its holdings, at the rates applicable to for-profit corporations.
- **Transparency**: All institutions meeting one of the criteria above must file annual public financial disclosures, subject to audit by the state revenue service, to ensure accurate assessment.
6. **The "No Special Access" Rule:**
- Religious institutions apply for building permits under the exact same process and criteria as any other private social or community assembly (e.g., a private club, a community center, a lecture hall). No fast-tracking, no special exemptions from standard safety, environmental, or infrastructure impact reviews.
- **The "Scale and Footprint" Regulation**:
- **Purpose:** To prevent the construction of massive, domineering structures that visually and culturally claim a territory.
- **Mechanism:** Zoning codes can legally regulate the height, square footage, and a lot coverage of all buildings in a zone. A mosque, temple, or church cannot exceed the size limitations imposed on other assembly halls in that same zone. This prevents the construction of a mega-church in a residential neighborhood.
- **The "Buffer Zone" for Residential and Civic Core Areas**:
* **Purpose:** To maintain the secular sanctity of the most fundamental community spaces.
* **Mechanism:** Zoning can establish that within a certain radius of public schools, courthouses, and legislative buildings, no land may be used for purpose-build religious structures. This creates a clear, secular civic core.
* Any consistent and ongoing discrimination or favoritism shall be met with civil suits. No city, as directed by this document's very nature, is allowed to be a theocratic zone. Every member of the offending city council may be removed in a case-by-case basis.
- **The "Industrial/Commercial" for Large Structures**:
* **Purpose:** To acknowledge the reality that a large religious complex operates like a major institution, not a quiet community house.
* **Mechanism:** Any religious structure intended to serve a congregation over a certain size (e.g., 500 members) must be built in zones designated for commercial assembly or light industrial use. It would be alongside conference centers, theaters, and large restaurants, not in the middle of a quiet neighborhood. This treats it according to its functional impact (traffic, noise, parking), not its theological purpose.

**Framer's Justification:** _Clause 6 is designed as an absolute barrier to theocracy. Any ideology—religious or secular—that asserts the legal supremacy of a specific religious doctrine over this Constitution, or that seeks to deny any person the fundamental rights enumerated in Article I based on their adherence (or non-adherence) to a religious doctrine, is definitionally incompatible with public office. This applies regardless of the ideology's self-described name, tradition, or interpretation. The test is objective: does the ideology's core program require the state to enforce religious law or privilege a specific faith? If yes, it is disqualified._

### Section 3: Freedom of Expression & Belief

1. Freedom of thought, conscience, speech, press, assembly, association, and religion shall be inviolable.
2. These freedoms may be subject only to such reasonable limitations as are necessary to prevent imminent lawless action, incitement to violence, defamation, or genuine threats to national security.
3. There shall be no law against blasphemy, as such would violate free speech.
4. A judicial finding that an individual has publicly engaged in incitement to violence or hatred based on a protected characteristic shall render that person ineligible to hold public office.

### Section 4: Resolution of Conflicting Rights

1. Where the exercise of one fundamental right unavoidably infringes upon the core of another, the state, through its courts, shall seek a resolution that minimizes the impairment to both.
2. In such conflicts, no right is automatically superior. The court shall consider:
- The historical context and vulnerability of the parties involved.
- The availability of reasonable alternatives for each party.
- The principle of least restrictive means.
3. This section shall not be used to justify the suspension of rights under Article I, Section 17, nor shall it be used to elevate property or commercial interests above the rights to bodily autonomy, freedom of conscience, or protection from discrimination.

### Section 5: Safeguarding Democratic Integrity

1. Any person who, through public speech, association, or action, has demonstrated a sustained adherence to an ideology that explicitly advocates for the abolition of democratic institutions, the establishment of a dictatorship, or the denial of fundamental rights and equal protection to any group based on a characteristic protected under Article I, Section 1, shall be ineligible to hold public office.
2. A finding of ineligibility under this section may only be made by the Supreme Court, following a public, adversarial hearing initiated by the Citizens' Assembly or by a majority vote of Congress. The burden of proof shall be on the petitioners to demonstrate a clear and present danger to the constitutional order.
3. This provision shall not be used to suppress mere political dissent or unpopular opinions that stop short of advocating for the destruction of constitutional democracy.

### Section 6: Bodily Autonomy & Medical Privacy

1. Every person has exclusive and inalienable rights over their own body, health decisions, and personal privacy.
2. Healthcare information shall remain strictly private and confidential, except:
- Pursuant to valid judicial warrant based on probable cause (e.g., identifying a murder victim)
- For mandatory testing following accidents causing serious injury or significant property damage, as defined by law.
- For anonymous, non-identifying public health reporting of communicable diseases.
3. The rights to abortion and voluntary sterilization are recognized as fundamental components of bodily autonomy. The denial of timely access to these services by any institution operating within or regulated by the public health system constitutes a violation of this section.
4. **Guarantee of Access to Reproductive Services**:
- The rights to abortion and voluntary sterilization are recognized as fundamental components of bodily autonomy. The state bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring effective and universal access to these services.
- **Prohibition of Unreasonable Denial**: No healthcare provider shall deny a patient's request for a legally available elective procedure, including voluntary sterilization, based on the provider's personal judgment regarding the patient's age, perceived future desires, marital status, parity, or spousal consent. A provider may only deny such a request for bona fide, documented clinical contraindications that present a significant and immediate risk to the patient's life.
- **Immediate Duty to Refer**: If a healthcare provider is unwilling to perform a legally available procedure for any reason, including conscientious objection or lack of specific training, they have an immediate, non-delegable duty to facilitate a seamless and timely referral to a willing and qualified provider. This referral must be provided without delay, administrative impediment, or additional cost to the patient. The patient's care must be transitioned without interruption.
- **Institutional Liability**: Any public institution or private entity receiving public funding that fails to guarantee access as outlined in this Clause shall be deemed in violation of this section. The institution itself bears ultimate legal and financial responsibility for any denial or undue delay of care caused by its policies or failure of its referral system.
- In addition to professional discipline, a provider found in violation shall be civilly liable to the patient for significant damages, including compensation for emotional distress and any additional costs incurred.
- A pattern of such violations within a healthcare institution shall trigger a mandatory investigation by the relevant state authority and may result in the suspension of public funding and the initiation of criminal proceedings against responsible administrators for systemic deprivation of constitutional rights.
5. **Enhanced Accountability for Denial of Care**
- A healthcare provider who willfully and knowingly violates Clause 4.2 of this section by denying a procedure without a bona fide clinical justification, or who violates Clause 4.3 by obstructing a referral, shall be subject to professional disciplinary action, including mandatory retraining and the potential suspension or revocation of their medical license.
- In addition to professional discipline, a provider found in violation shall be civilly liable to the patient for significant damages, including compensation for emotional distress and any additional costs incurred.
- A pattern of such violations within a healthcare institution shall trigger a mandatory investigation by the relevant state authority and may result in the suspension of public funding and the initiation of criminal proceedings against responsible administrators for systemic deprivation of constitutional rights.
6. **Prohibition on Bodily Mandates**:
- Neither the state, nor any institution acting under its authority, shall mandate any medical treatment, procedure, pharmaceutical, implant, genetic therapy, or any other substance or intervention that enters, alters, or is performed upon the body of a non-consenting individual.
- This right is absolute and is not negated by any finding of safety, efficacy, or medical necessity. It may not be suspended, even under a declaration of emergency.
- This clause shall not be construed to limit the state's power to enact and enforce isolation, quarantine, or other public health measures that restrict movement or association to prevent the spread of contagious disease, provided such measures do not compel a specific medical intervention as defined in the first paragraph of this clause.

### Section 7: Environmental Rights

1. Every person has the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.
2. The state shall act as trustee of natural resources for present and future generations.
3. Environmental impact assessments shall be required for major public and private projects.

### Section 8: Digital Privacy & Autonomy

1. The privacy of personal digital data and communications shall be inviolable, unless the individual is subject to a criminal investigation or is currently on parole or probation.
2. Bulk data collection by the state is prohibited.
3. Individuals have the right to access, control, and delete their personal data.

### Section 9: Protection Against Synthetic Media and Digital Forgery

1. **Right to Digital Identity and Consent**: Every person has an inviolable right to their own likeness, voice, and digital identity. The non-consensual creation, alteration, or distribution of a realistic synthetic media representation of an individual ("DeepFake") is a severe violation of personal autonomy.
2. **Categorization of Offenses**: The misuse of synthetic media shall be categorized and penalized based on intent and harm:
- **Non-Consensual Intimate Depictions**: The creation or distribution of sexually explicit DeepFakes without consent shall be a felony, punishable by imprisonment and significant fines, recognizing it as a form of sexual abuse and harassment.
- **Defamatory and Reputational Harm**: The creation or distribution of DeepFakes with the intent to defame, harass, or cause severe emotional distress shall be subject to enhanced penalties, significantly greater than those for equivalent libel or slander committed with traditional media.
- **Fraud and Election Interference**: The use of DeepFakes to commit fraud, impersonate a public official, or interfere with an election or official government proceeding shall be a felony punishable by imprisonment commensurate with the threat posed to national security and democratic integrity.
- **Blackmail or Extortion**: This is the most serious offense in terms of fraud and defamation, as it violates human dignity for financial gain. Look at Article II for more information.
3. **Strict Liability for Malicious Distribution**: Any person who knowingly distributes a DeepFake they are aware is maliciously created shall be subject to criminal liability as an accomplice.
4. **Mandatory Disclosure**: All synthetic media that has been materially altered in a way that could fool a reasonable person must be clearly and prominently labeled as such The use of undisclosed DeepFakes for commercial or political communication shall be strictly prohibited.
5. **Affirmative Defense**: It shall be an affirmative defense to charges under this section that the media was clearly labeled as synthetic, used for obvious parody, satire, or artistic expression, or created with the explicit, verifiable consent of the individual depicted.

### Section 10: The Right to Self-Defense and Bearing Arms

1. The right of the people to keep and bear small arms, including all legally possessed firearms operable by a single person, for self-defense, security, and other lawful purposes shall not be infringed. This right pertains to individual weapons and shall not be construed to apply to crew-served weapons, ordnance, or weapons of mass destruction.
2. Any person of legal age to operate a motor vehicle shall have the unrestricted right to acquire, possess, and carry non-lethal defensive instruments. No license shall be required for such instruments.
3. **Regulated Access to Lethal Arms**
- Citizens aged 18 and older shall have the right to keep and bear such arms.
- The purchase of firearms by citizens between ages 18 and 25 may be required a license, as determined by law.
- Any licensing process, if enacted, shall be free of charge, shall certify completion of safety and legal training, and shall not be used as a mechanism for discriminatory denial.
- A license solely for the ownership of a firearm already legally possessed shall never be imposed.
4. **Licensing as a Mark of Responsibility**
- A firearms license shall serve as a certificate of training and responsible ownership.
- During periods of heightened security or martial law, licensed ownership may facilitate cooperation with state authorities by demonstrating the bearer is a trained and law-abiding citizen.
5. This right shall not extend to individuals convicted of violent felonies or who are subject to active protective orders for domestic violence, as determined by a court of law.
6. **Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs)**
- **Purpose:** To prevent individuals who pose a significant and immediate danger to themselves or others from accessing lethal arms during a period of crisis.
- **Temporary Order:** A law enforcement officer or immediate family member may petition a court for a temporary ERPO. Upon a finding of probable cause, a judge may issue an order, valid for not more than 14 days, requiring the surrender of firearms pending a full hearing. This order may be issued *ex parte* (without the subject present).
- **Full Hearing:** Before the temporary order expires, a full hearing must be held where the subject has the right to be present, to legal counsel, and to confront evidence. A final ERPO may be issued for up to one year based on clear and convincing evidence.
- **Safeguards:** Knowingly filing a false petition shall be a felony. All surrendered weapons must be promptly returned upon the order's expiration.
7. **Municipal Regulation of Discharge:** 
- The right to bear arms shall not be construed to prohibit a municipality from regulating the discharge of firearms within its jurisdiction to ensure public safety.
- **Such regulations may include, but are not limited to:**
* Prohibiting discharge within a specified minimum distance of any occupied dwelling, school, or public park without the express written consent of the owner.
* Enacting and enforcing reasonable noise ordinances that apply to the sound of gunfire.
* Requiring the use of a certified backstop or range safety system for any target practice on residential property.
- These regulations shall be presumed constitutional if they are narrowly tailored to address documented public safety risks and do not function as a de facto blanket ban on the lawful use of firearms for self-defense or recreation within the municipality.

**Framer's Justification:** _The right to self-defense does not exist in a vacuum. It must be balanced with the right of one's neighbors to domestic security and peace. This provision empowers communities to enact common-sense safety measures to prevent stray bullets and noise pollution, without infringing on the core right of law-abiding citizens to own and use firearms responsibly. It allows a city to stop someone from firing a rifle in a crowded subdivision, while protecting the ability of a rural resident to practice on their own land._

### Section 11: Right to Domestic Privacy

1. Every person has the right to privacy within their lawful residence and its immediate grounds.
2. This right includes a reasonable expectation of privacy from unaided surveillance in outdoor areas such as yards, patios, and balconies.
3. To secure this right, residents shall have the right to reasonable modifications, such as the construction of privacy-enhancing fences, walls, or vegetation screens, for the duration of their residence.

> **Framer's quote**: "This right is founded upon the principle that the core activities of private life must be protected from unreasonable observation within one's lawful residence."

4. The state, through the Public Housing Trust or other relevant bodies, shall facilitate these modifications upon resident request. Local ordinances may establish reasonable regulations regarding the height, materials, and safety of such structures, but shall not prohibit them from outright or regulate them in a manner that effectively nullifies this right.
5. **Limitation for Supervised Individuals**:
- Persons serving a term of probation or parole as a condition of their release from incarceration shall have a diminished expectation of domestic privacy.
- As a condition of their release, such individuals may be subject to warrantless searches of their person, residence, and vehicle by their supervising officer, provided the search is based on reasonable suspicion of a violation of their release conditions and is not conducted for the purpose of harassment.
- This limitation is specific to the terms of supervision and does not constitute a blanket waiver of other constitutional rights.

### Section 12: Right to Dissolve Marriage (No-Fault Divorce)

1. The right to dissolve a marriage is inviolable. No person shall be compelled by the state to remain legally married against their will.
> **Framer's Quote**: "This provision is necessary to prevent individuals from being legally trapped in relationships that are unsafe or devoid of mutual consent, thereby upholding their fundamental rights to liberty and security."
2. The Republic shall recognize and facilitate no-fault divorce. Upon the petition of either party to a marriage, the state shall grant a dissolution of the marriage without requiring the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, such as adultery, abandonment, or cruelty, by the other party.
3. The primary considerations of the court in a divorce proceeding shall be the equitable division of marital property, and the welfare and best interests of any dependent children. The court shall not deny or delay a divorce decree based on the objection or lack of consent of the other party.
4. This right ensures that individuals are not forced to remain in unwanted or harmful relationships and is a necessary corollary to the rights of liberty, privacy, and bodily autonomy.

### Section 13: Freedom of Private Relationship Structures

1. The state shall not criminalize or penalize private, consensual relationships between adults, regardless of the number of participants.
2. No person shall be prosecuted for the crime of adultery, cohabitation, or polygamy based solely on the private, consensual structure of their relationships.

**Adultery** - Voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person who is not their spouse. Under this Constitution, adultery is not a criminal offense. The regulation of fidelity within a relationship is a private matter between individuals, not a subject for state intervention. Laws against adultery violate the rights to privacy and bodily autonomy (Art. I, Sec. 6 & 11) by criminalizing private, consensual sexual conduct between adults.

**Polygamy** - The state of being simultaneously married to more than one spouse. Under this Constitution, the practice of polygamy, as a private, consensual relationship structure between adults, is decriminalized. However, official state recognition of marriage is limited to two persons. Adults in multi-partner relationships are directed to use private contracts to define their legal relationships. (Ref: Art. I, Sec. 13)

3. The legal recognition of marriage by the state is limited to the union of two persons for the purposes of defining next-of-kin, inheritance, tax status, and parental rights. This legal construct is separate from religious or social definitions of marriage.
4. Adults in multi-partner relationships shall have the right to enter into private contracts to define the terms of their shared life, including property rights, financial obligations, and medical decision-making authority. Such contracts shall be enforceable in civil court, subject to standard contract law principles and protections against fraud and coercion.

### Section 14: Suspension of Rights During Emergency

1. The fundamental rights enumerated in this Article, with the sole exception of the right to life and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, may be temporarily suspended but not terminated, to the extent strictly necessary to address an existential threat to the nation during a formally declared state of emergency under Article VI.
2. Any such suspension must be:
- Proportional to the severity of the threat.
- Limited in duration to the active declaration of emergency.
- Subject to immediate and continuous review by the Supreme Court to ensure it does not exceed the strict necessities of the situation.
3. The rights to Bodily Autonomy (Section 6) and Domestic Privacy (Section 11) are granted the highest level of protection. Any suspension of these specific rights requires an additional, specific declaration by the Citizens' Assembly with a ⅔ majority vote, and may only be authorized for the narrowest and most critical of purposes.
4. **Penalty for Abuse**: Any public official who willfully and knowingly declares an emergency or suspends rights under this section without a legitimate, good-faith belief in an existential threat, or who suspends rights beyond what is strictly necessary, is guilty of a supreme offense against the state. Upon conviction, they shall be subject to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or, if the abuse resulted in widespread loss of life or the permanent dissolution of a fundamental right, the death penalty.

### Section 15: Right to Safe Emancipation for Minors

1. **Right to Petition**: 
- Any minor aged 16 or older who can demonstrate to a court, through clear and convincing evidence, that their place of residence poses a demonstratable and severe threat to their physical safety or psychological integrity, shall have the right to petition for legal emancipation. Such threats include, but are not limited to, abuse, neglect, exposure to the presence of substance abuse or profit of substances, violence, or being forced into a marriage arrangement.
- Forced marriage, even conspired, shall always subject parents and the would-be spouse to the maximum penalty. The victim can file for their parents' early release after age 25.
2. **Guaranteed Counsel**: The state shall provide an attorney to the minor at no cost to assist in the preparation and presentation of their petition to the court. The court shall prioritize the swift adjudication of such petitions.
3. **Limited Scope of Emancipation**: A grant of emancipation under this section is specifically for the purpose of establishing a separate, safe residence and managing the finances necessary to support it. It does not constitute a grant of the full age of majority. Emancipated minors under this section remain subject to all other laws pertaining to minors, including compulsory education laws.
4. **Economic Protections**: A minor emancipated under this section shall be exempt from all residential property tax, in accordance with Article III, Section 1, and shall be eligible for state support to ensure access to adequate housing, as guaranteed by Article III.
5. **Consequence for Guardians**: A finding by the court that justifies emancipation under this section may serve as grounds for a separate criminal investigation or child endangerment proceedings against the parent or guardian, at the discretion of the relevant authorities. The primary purpose of this section is the protection of the minor, not the punishment of the guardian.

### Section 16: Rights of Immigrant Children and Youth

1. **Birthright Citizenship**: Any child born within the territory of the Republic shall be a citizen thereof, subject to the jurisdiction thereof, regardless of the citizenship or immigration status of the child's parents.
2. **Guaranteed Legal Residency for Minors**:
- Every minor under the age of 18 who is physically present within the jurisdiction of the Republic, and who is not a citizen, shall be granted immediate legal residency.
- This status shall be automatically maintained until the individual reaches the age of 25.
3. **Pathway to Citizenship**
- Individuals granted residency under this section shall have the right to apply for citizenship at any time after reaching the age of 18.
- The process for application must be free of charge, and may only require demonstration of good character and a commitment to the principles of the Constitution.
4. **Protection from Deportation**: No individual who was granted legal residency as a minor under this section shall be subject to deportation or removal from the Republic before reaching the age of 25, provided they have not been convicted of a violent felony.
5. **Purpose and Intent**: This section is established to provide stability, security, and a clear path to full membership in the Republic for those who arrive as children, recognizing that they are blameless for their circumstances and deserve the opportunity to fully contribute to society.

### Section 17: Right to Asylum from Persecution

1. Any person who faces a credible threat of persecution, including state-sanctioned violence or execution, in their country of origin for their membership in a group, or for an immutable or fundamental characteristic, that is protected from discrimination under Article I, Section 1 of this Constitution, shall be granted asylum in the Republic.
2. A person claiming asylum under this section shall be given a presumption of credibility. The burden of proof shall be on the state to rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.
3. Asylum claims made under this section shall be processed in an expedited manner. Applicants shall be granted temporary legal residency, the right to work, and access to essential services until their claim is adjudicated.
4. No person shall be deported, extradited, or otherwise returned to a territory where they would face a credible threat of persecution as defined in this section.

### Section 18: Law Enforcement Identification and Transparency

1. **Principle of Identifiable Authority**: No agent of the state, including any law enforcement officer, peacekeeper, or member of the security services, shall be permitted to conceal their identity while interacting with the public or executing their duties.
2. **Mandatory Identification**:
- All uniforms must clearly display a unique, legible badge number or service identifier.
- Upon request by any member of the public, an officer must verbally state their full badge number and surname.
3. **Limited Exemption for Facial Concealment**:
- The concealment of an officer's face is permitted only when there is a specific, articulable, and credible threat to that officer's physical safety that would be mitigated by facial concealment, or for the purpose of operating in an environment requiring biological containment (e.g., a biohazard scene).
- Even under this exemption, the officer's badge number must remain fully visible, and the reason for the concealment must be documented in a subsequent activity report.
4. **Prohibition on Anonymous Force**: The deployment of any unit whose standard operating procedure includes the routine concealment of all identifying features (e.g., "robocop" armor without badges, unmarked uniforms) is strictly forbidden. The state's power must always have a name and a number.
5. **Penalty for Violation**: Any officer who willfully conceals their identity or badge number in violation of this section shall be subject to immediate suspension and disciplinary action. Any evidence gathered or action taken by an officer who is in violation of this section at the time of the incident shall be presumptively inadmissible in any proceeding.
6. **Limited Exemption for Covert Operations**
- **Authorization**: The routine concealment of identity by a law enforcement officer is permited only pursuant to a Covert Operations Warrant issued by a panel of three judges from a designated security court.
- **Necessity Requirement**: A warrant may only be issued upon a finding of specific, articulable, and credible evidence that:
* A severe felony, as defined in Article II, is being planned or committed by a structured, clandestine organization, and
* Conventional investigative techniques are insufficient to uncover the conspiracy, and
* The concealment of the officer's identity is strictly necessary to prevent imminent violence or the dissolution of a fundamental right.
- **Scope and Limitation**:
* The warrant shall specify the named targets, the specific criminal organization if the name is applicable, the duration of the authorization (not to exceed 90 days, renewable only upon a new finding), and the specific investigative acts permitted.
* This authorization does not permit the officer to entrap, incite, or initiate criminal activity when there is a potential victim. Its sole purpose is the passive gathering of intelligence.
* All evidence gathered by an officer operating under this warrant shall be presumptively inadmissible unless the prosecution can demonstrate strict adherence to its terms.
7. **Oversight and Penalty**:
- A full, unredacted record of all activities conducted under this warrant shall be sealed and submitted to the oversight committee of the Citizens' Assembly upon the operation's conclusion.
- Any officer who willfully operates outside the scope of a Covert Operations Warrant, or any official who approves a warrant in bad faith, shall be subject to the enhanced penalties of Article II, Section 3.

### Section 19: RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

1. **Affirmative Right to Flourish**: Every person has the right to live with dignity, to develop their personality, and to flourish as an equal member of society. The State shall guarantee this right to all persons, including those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, by proactively identifying and eliminating barriers to full and equal participation.
2. **Freedom from Discrimination and the Duty of Reasonable Accommodation**:
- It is unlawful to discriminate against any person on the basis of disability in employment, education, housing, healthcare, transportation, access to public services, and the administration of justice.
- All public entities and private entities offering public accommodations have a mandatory duty to provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities. This duty is enforceable, and the burden of proving that an accommodation imposes an "undue hardship" shall be a high bar, resting on the entity denying the accommodation.
- A state-funded Central Accommodation Fund shall be established to assist small businesses and public institutions in covering the costs of significant accommodations, removing financial capacity as a justification for undue hardship.
3. **Legal Capacity and Supported Decision-Making**:
- All persons enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. Plenary guardianship that removes legal personhood is abolished.
- Every person has the right to be recognized as a full legal actor. The state shall ensure that persons with disabilities who require assistance in exercising their legal capacity have access to supported decision-making arrangements of their choice, in which a trusted supporter assists them in understanding, making, and communicating decisions, while the individual retains their full legal capacity and final decision-making authority.
4. **Right to Live in the Community**:
- Persons with disabilities have the right to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others, and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement.
- No public funds shall be used to construct or maintain new segregated, long-term care institutions. The state shall develop a comprehensive system of personalized home- and community-based services (HCBS), including personal assistance, accessible housing, and community support networks, to ensure this right is effective.
5. **Inclusive Education**:
- The State shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels. The presumption of placement for every child, regardless of disability, shall be in a general education classroom in their local school.
- Schools have a duty to collaborate and provide necessary supports, accommodations, and specialized staff within the mainstream classroom to facilitate effective education.
6. **Universal Design as a Guiding Principle**: Universal Design shall be a guiding principle for all new public infrastructure, services, technology, and information, ensuring they are usable by all people to the greatest extent possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

### Section 20: Right and Protection of Whistleblowers

1. **The Public's Right to Know:** The people have a fundamental right to be informed of wrongdoing, corruption, gross mismanagement, criminal activity, or dangers to public health and safety within any institution, public or private, that operates under the authority or regulation of the Republic.
2. **Protected Acts:** Any person who, based on a reasonable, good-faith belief, discloses information about an activity, policy, or practice that they believe constitutes a violation of law, regulation, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a gross waste of public funds, shall be protected from retaliation. Protected disclosures include, but are not limited to, reports made to:
- A supervisor or internal reporting body.
- A law enforcement or regulatory agency.
- The Citizens' Assembly or its designated investigative committee.
- The press or the public, if internal channels are ineffective, obstructed, or if the threat is imminent.
3. **Absolute Protection from Retaliation:** 
- No person shall be subject to prosecution, dismissal, demotion, suspension, harassment, blacklisting, or any other form of retaliation by their employer, the state, or any other entity for making a protected disclosure.
- The burden of proof shall be on the employer or the state to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that any adverse action taken against a whistleblower was for a legitimate, independent reason wholly unrelated to the protected disclosure.
4. **Monetary Reward and Restitution:**
- A whistleblower whose disclosure leads to a successful prosecution, a significant monetary recovery for the state, or the prevention of substantial public harm shall be entitled to a significant percentage of the funds recovered or a substantial state-funded reward, as determined by law.
- Any whistleblower who suffers retaliation shall be entitled to full reinstatement, triple back-pay, compensation for all damages (including emotional distress), and attorney's fees.
5. **Criminal Penalty for Retaliators:** Any individual, whether a public official or private manager, who knowingly and willfully engages in the retaliation of a whistleblower shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and permanent disqualification from holding any position of public trust or managing the labor of others.

**Framer's Justification:** _The "Poisoned Chalice" makes corruption dangerous for the corrupter. But a state that does not actively protect and reward those with the courage to expose corruption from within is a state that is only half-serious about justice. This provision ensures that the first person to see a crime become not a target, but a hero of the Republic._

### Section 21: Right to Timely Forensic Investigation in Sexual Assault Cases

1. **The Right to a Functional Investigation:** Any person who reports a sexual assault to law enforcement has the right to a thorough and timely investigation. The state's failure to process and analyze forensic evidence constitutes a denial of this right and an abdication of its duty to provide equal protection under the law.
2. **Mandatory Processing of Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence (SAFE Kits):**
- All Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) kits, commonly known as "rape kits," collected pursuant to a reported assault shall be submitted to an accredited forensic laboratory within thirty (30) days of their collection.
- The forensic analysis of a submitted SAFE kit must be completed, and the results entered into relevant law enforcement databases, within ninety (90) days of its submission to the laboratory, barring exceptional and documented circumstances that prevent processing, which must be reviewed by a court.
3. **Statewide Tracking System:** 
- The state shall establish and maintain a centralized, electronic tracking system for all SAFE kits.
- This system shall allow a victim, through a secure and private access code, to monitor the status and location of their kit from collection through to final analysis, without requiring direct contact with investigating officers.
4. **Annual Audit and Public Reporting:** 
- The Citizens' Assembly, through its investigative powers, shall commission an annual public audit of the state's compliance with this section.
- The audit shall report the number of kits collected, submitted, processed, and remaining backlogged, and shall identify any systemic failures or resource shortages.
5. **Cause of Action and Enforcement:** 
- A victim, or the Citizens' Assembly on behalf of the public interest, may bring a cause of action against the relevant law enforcement agency or the state for failure to comply with the time limits mandated in Clause 2.
- A court finding of a violation shall result in a mandatory writ of mandamus compelling immediate action and the allocation of necessary funds to clear the backlog. The responsible public officials shall be subject to professional discipline and may be held in contempt of court.

**Framer's Justification:** _A rape kit that sits on a shelf is a promise broken by the state. It tells a victim that their pursuit of justice is not a priority. This provision transforms that kit from a symbol of neglect into an enforceable right to a functional investigation. It mandates the state to do its job, providing victims with transparency and accountability where there has traditionally been delay and obscurity._

4. Exoneration is not a pardon.

### Section 11: Criminal Conspiracy and Complicity

1. Principle of Intent: The Republic recognizes that conspiracy—the deliberate planning and agreement to commit a felony—demonstrates a fixed criminal intent that poses a clear and present danger to the social order. The mental culpability of conspiracy is commensurate with that of the completed felony.
2. Tier 1: Concrete Conspiracy: Any person who knowingly agrees with one or more persons to commit a felony, and who commits a concrete overt act in furtherance of that agreement, is guilty of conspiracy.
3. Sentencing for Conspiracy: A conviction for conspiracy shall be punishable by a sentence equivalent to that prescribed for the underlying felony. Sentencing judges shall have discretion within the statutory range to consider the nature of the overt act and the specific danger posed by the plot, but shall not sentence below a mandatory minimum of [e.g., 50%] of the maximum penalty for the underlying felony.

### Section 12: The Doctrine of Substance Over Form of Anti-Evasion

1. Principle of Economic Reality: In the application and enforcement of the laws of the Republic, the substance, economic reality, and actual purpose of arrangements shall prevail over its legal form. This principle shall be known as the Doctrine of Substance Over Form.
2. Anti-Evasion Mandate: No person or entity shall be permitted to avoid the intent, application, or consequences of the law through the use of artificial, complex, or opaque structures that have no substantial purpose other than to evade legal obligations, taxes, or regulatory oversight.

- Courts with regulatory agencies are hereby empowered and required to disregard the separate legal identities of affiliated entities, or the specific form of transaction, when it is established that the principal purpose was to evade a legal obligation.
- In such cases, the courts shall have the authority to consolidate the assets and liabilities of affiliated entities, recharacterized transactions according to their economic substance, and impose liability on the controlling parties behind the attempt of tax evasion.
4. Burden of Proof: In any proceeding where the state alleges an arrangement has been made for the principle purpose of evasion, the burden shall shift to the defendant(s) to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the arrangement had a bona fide, substantial purpose independent of tax or regulatory avoidance.
5. Liability for Aiding Evasion: Lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, and other professionals who knowingly design, promote, or implement schemes whose principle purpose is the evasion of law shall be subject to prosecuting accomplices, including penalties commensurate with the offense they aided.

- Being caught with a non-government device, or altering software to bypass any monitoring mechanisms of such a device, shall be grounds for five years in prison, and permanent forfeiture of using non-government devices.
- Being caught using a device with previously mentioned details shall constitute as life in prison.
- If the offender is a foreigner, they will be wanted for the rest of their lives. Any country that allows extradition will be guaranteed the offending individual does not face the death penalty until they commit a crime on our soil that warrants such.

### Section 14: Protection from Double Jeopardy and Prosecutional Oppression

1. The Right of Finality: No person shall be subject to a second prosecution or punishment for the same offense after a lawful acquittal or conviction.
2. The "Same Offense" Defined: Two offenses are the same for the purposes of this section if they are based on the same physical act or course of conduct, unless each offense requires proof of a distinct and independent element that the other does not, and the elements address substantively different harms to the social order.
3. The Absolute Bar: An acquittal by any court of competent jurisdiction is final and irrevocable. The state shall have no right of appeal against a verdict of acquittal.
4. The Militant Exception - Prosecutorial Misconduct: If a court finds that a prosecutor has sought a second trial for the same offense in bad faith, or with the intent to harass or oppress the defendant after an acquittal, the following shall apply:
- The prosecutor shall be immediately disbarred.
- The prosecutor shall be charged with the felony of "Attempted Deprivation of Constitutional Rights," punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence equivalent to the maximum sentence for the offense they attempted to re-prosecute.
- The defendant shall be entitled to civil damages from the prosecutor's personal assets, equivalent to ten times the cost of their legal defense for both trials.
5. The Socialist Exception - Collateral Consequences: This section does not prohibit civil proceedings, conducted by the Worker's Branch or other relevant body, to secure restitution for victims, or to seek the equitable disgorgement of illicit profits, provided such proceedings are not punitive in nature and do not threaten the liberty of the person.

### Section 15: Remedial Powers for Weaponized Defamation

1. Finding of Weaponized Defamation: In any case where a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a party has engaged in weaponized defamation – defined as the deliberate, malicious, and viral distortion of factual statements to incite hatred or violence against a person or group – the court may, in addition to standard damages, issue a Corrective Equity Order.
2. The Corrective Equity Order: This order is designed not to punish, but to restore the factual record and deprive the defamation of its corrosive power. The order must be the least restrictive means to achieve this goal and is subject to the following absolute constraints:
- It shall NEVER involve compelled speech. No individual or entity shall be forced to utter, create, or broadcast any message.
- It shall NEVER violate bodily autonomy as defined in Article I, Section 6.
- It shall NEVER impose a prior restraint on future speech.
3. Authorized Remedies: The court's order may compel one or more of the following actions, tailored to the scale and nature of the defamation:
- Mandatory Silence: The court may order the defaming party to refrain from speaking or publishing on the specific, falsified topic for a period not to exceed 90 days. This is a "cooling off" period to stop the viral lie from being repeatedly amplified. (This is a restriction on speech, but a targeted and temporary one, justified by the proven malicious intent).
- Asset Seizure for Corrective Advertising: The court may order the seizure of financial assets from the defaming party equivalent to 300% of the quantified damages. These seized funds are not a fine; they are placed in a state-managed fund. The defamed party, or a designated public-interest entity, can use these funds exclusively to purchase airtime, digital ads, or print space on any platform of their choice to present their own message and correct the record. The defamer has no control over this message.
- Platform Access Surrender: In cases of viral digital defamation, the court may order the defaming party to surrender their access to their primary platform of offense (e.g., their Twitter/X account, YouTube channel) for a period of 30-90 days. The account would be placed in a protected, inactive state, preventing posting but leaving the original defamatory content visible as a matter of public record. This directly attacks the tool of the harm without compelling the platform to broadcast anything.
4. Judicial Discretion and Appeal: The presiding judge must provide a written justification for the chosen remedy, explaining why it is the least restrictive means to correct the harm. All Corrective Equity Orders are subject to immediate, expedited appeal to the Supreme Court.

### Section 16: Prohibition on Polygraph Evidence

1. **Findings of Fact:** The Republic finds that psychophysiological deception detection devices, commonly known as "lie detectors" or polygraphs, measure physiological responses that are not unique to deception. These responses can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including anxiety, fear, confusion, physiological conditions, and cultural background. The scientific consensus holds that there is no physiological response or pattern of responses that is specific to deception, rendering such evidence fundamentally unreliable.
2. **Prohibition on Use in Legal Proceedings:**
- The results of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an individual's willingness or refusal to take a polygraph test shall be inadmissible as evidence in any court, administrative hearing, or other legal proceeding within the Republic.
- This prohibition applies to all parties, including the prosecution, defense, and civil litigants.
3. **Prohibition on Use by Law Enforcement:**
- No law enforcement agency, intelligence service, or any other organ of the state shall require, request, or suggest that a witness, suspect, or victim submit to a polygraph examination as a condition of investigation or cooperation.
- No adverse inference shall be drawn from an individual's refusal to participate in a polygraph test.
4. **Prohibition on Use in Employment:** No public or private employer shall require, request, or suggest that an employee or prospective employee submit to a polygraph examination as a condition of employment, promotion, or continued employment.
5. **Exceptions for Voluntary Scientific Research:** The provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit voluntary participation in academic, scientific, or medical research conducted with informed consent and under the oversight of a recognized ethical review board, provided no results are used for the purposes prohibited in Clauses 2, 3, and 4.

**Framer's Justification:** _A justice system founded on reason and evidence cannot be built upon a foundation of junk science. The polygraph is a tool of intimidation and coercion, not of truth-seeking. Its ban is necessary to protect the innocent from false positives, the vulnerable from psychological pressure, and the integrity of the Republic's legal process from pseudoscientific theatrics._

2. Grandfathering with Conditions: Persons who legally owned residential rental properties at the time of ratification may retain them. The right to retain a non-primary-residence property is contingent upon it serving as a home. Any such property must have a tenant residing in it under a lawful agreement for the majority of a given calendar year.
3. The Five-Year Vacancy Rule: If a grandfathered residential property is without a tenant for a continuous period of five (5) years, the owner's use-rights are deemed abandoned. The property shall automatically revert to the Public Housing Trust without compensation.
4. End of Landlordism: Upon the death of a grandfathered property owner, the right to hold residential property for rental purposes expires. The property must be sold to the Public Housing Trust or become the primary residence of an heir.

### Section 4: Agricultural Rights

3. Funding shall be allocated from municipal budgets with federal matching funds.

### Section 8: Right to Repair

1. Consumers and independent repair businesses shall have a comprehensive right to repair the equipment, devices, and digital products they own.
2. Manufacturers of such products shall not impede this right through technical, legal, or logistical barriers.
3. To facilitate this right, manufacturers shall be required to make available to the public, on fair and reasonable terms:
- Diagnostic information, software, and firmware: All manuals, schematics, and software tools needed for diagnosis, maintenance, and repair.
- Spare parts and tools: All spare parts, including components and assemblies, and specialized tools required for repair.
- No discriminatory restrictions: The terms of access for owners and independent repair providers shall be no less favorable than those provided to the manufacturer's own authorized repair networks.
4. The prohibition on "software locks" that prevent repair: The circumvention of technological protection measures shall not be considered a violation of law when the purpose is diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of a lawfully owned product.
5. These obligations shall apply to products sold within the Republic, and Congress shall have the power to enact laws defining specific categories, timelines, and enforcement mechanisms to uphold this right.

### Section 9: Child Welfare

1. This is a socialist document. Even if one parent is absent and not reachable, the state will ensure the child's needs until they either turn 18 or graduate from high school.
2. However, if the male causes an unwanted pregnancy, or either is a clear danger to the partner or child, they are legally bound to pay back child support to the state as a form of legal punishment, in compliance with Clause 1.

### Section 10: Seed Sovereignty and Agricultural Resilience

1. **Purpose:** To safeguard the genetic heritage and food security of the Republic for all future generations, ensuring that the means of food production remain a public commons.

- This levy may be satisfied by depositing a quantity of viable, open-pollinated seed of verified quality and genetic diversity into the Public Seed Trust.
- Preference shall be given to heirloom, organic, and regionally adapted varieties.
4. **Right of Access and Reciprocal Enrichment:**
- Any resident shall have the right to borrow seeds from the Public Seed Trust.
- Upon harvest, borrowers shall return the principal amount of seed, plus a modest surplus to ensure the trust's growth and vitality.

**Framer's Justification:** _"A nation's true wealth is measured not in its currency, but in its capacity to feed itself. This provision recognizes seed as the fundamental unit of that capacity. By creating a circular economy of genetic wealth, we build a buffer against famine, corporate control, and ecological collapse. It transforms a tax from a financial transaction into a direct investment in our collective, biological future."_

### Section 9: Term Limits

1. No candidate, whether state or federal, shall run for a new term after age 65.
2. If the candidate is elected before age 65, they may complete their current term.

### Section 10: Limitation on Repeated Sortition Service

1. **Preamble and Rationale:**

To preserve the integrity of sortition as a true reflection of the common citizen, to prevent the consolidation of experiential advantage, and to distribute the burden and privilege of civic service as widely as possible among the populace, no citizen shall serve in a sortition-based branch more than once in their lifetime.

2. **The Permanent Ineligibility Registry:**
- A secure, automated, and publicly auditable National Civic Service Registry shall be maintained by the National Electoral Commission.
- Upon completion of a term in any sortition-based branch (Citizen's, Worker's, or Historian Branch), a citizen's unique identifier shall be permanently added to the Ineligible for Future Sortition list.
- The registry shall only record eligibility status (eligible/ineligible) and the branch served; it shall not contain performance reviews, voting records, or personal opinions from the service period.

3. **Scope of the Limitation:**
- The one-service limit applies across all sortition-based branches. A citizen who serves in the Citizen's Assembly is thereby rendered ineligible for future sortition to the Worker's Branch, Historian Branch, or another term in the Citizen's Assembly.
- This limitation applies only to sortition-based federal branches. It does not affect a citizen's right to:
* Vote in all elections.
* Run for elected office in the Legislative or Executive branches.
* Serve in appointed roles or as a professional civil servant.
* Be selected for local-level sortition bodies, if such exist.

4. **Exceptions and Safeguards:**
- **Medical Hardship:** A citizen selected who is medically certified as physically or psychologically unfit for service before the commencement of their term shall be excused and not added to the registry. Their slot shall be filled by the next randomly selected eligible citizen.
- **Verification and Appeal:** A citizen may formally appeal their inclusion in the registry only on the grounds of mistaken identity. The burden of proof for such an appeal shall be on the citizen.
- **Transparency:** The total number of citizens in the ineligible registry shall be public information, updated annually, to provide a measure of the system's reach.

5. **Implementation Clause:**
- This section shall take effect one year after ratification. The National Civic Service Registry shall be established during this period, initially populated with records of all citizens who have previously served in a sortition-based branch since the Constitution's ratification.

**Framer's Justification (for the record):** "The power of sortition is its power to disrupt. It breaks professional political classes, shatters careerist thinking, and forces the state to listen to the raw, unvarnished voice of its people. But any system, left to its own devices, will create a new elite. If the same person can be selected multiple times, we risk creating a 'civic service elite'—people who know the procedures, know the levers of power, and gain an un-democratic advantage over their truly novice peers. This amendment ensures the 'disruption' of sortition is permanent and widely distributed. It guarantees that the halls of power are forever filled with true amateurs, ensuring the government never loses touch with the reality of the governed. It is the final safeguard against the system becoming what it was designed to destroy."

2. The Role of the Historian Court:
- Upon a valid petition from the Citizens' Assembly or a majority vote of Congress, the Supreme Court shall not adjudicate the matter itself.
- Instead, it shall immediately refer the case to the Historian Court to conduct a Fact-Finding Inquest.
- The mandate of the Inquest is to establish, as a matter of historical fact, the answer to this question: "Does the preponderance of evidence—including public speeches, writings, associations, and actions—demonstrate that this individual adheres to an ideology or organization that advocates the abolition of democratic institutions or the denial of fundamental rights to any protected group?"
3. The Inquest Process: The Historian Court shall conduct public proceedings, acting as historical investigators. They will compile a dossier of evidence, hear from experts, and allow the subject of the inquest to present their own evidence. Their task is not to judge the person, but to establish the factual record of their affiliations, statements, and ideological commitments.
4. The Binding Finding: The Historian Court will issue a Binding Finding of Fact to the Supreme Court. This finding is limited to a "Yes" or "No" answer to the question posed in Clause 2c. The Historian Court's Finding of Fact is final and cannot be appealed on its merits.
5. The Supreme Court's Judicial Role: Upon receiving a "Yes" Finding from the Historian Court, the Supreme Court's role is purely judicial:
- To ensure due process was followed.
- To formally issue the decree of Permanent Disqualification from Public Office.
- If the Finding is "No," the Supreme Court must dismiss the petition.

4. Due Process Protection: Weapons may only be seized pursuant to individual judicial warrants.

### Section 5: Public Health Emergencies

1. Mask mandates in public spaces with exemptions.
2. Travel restrictions between high-risk zones.
3. Vaccination remains voluntary.

### Section 6: Tiered Enforcement under Public Health Emergencies

While vaccines or medical drugs are not a requirement, any violation during the quarantine carries incremental consequences.

1. First Offense: Warning and education.
2. Second Offense: 14-day protective detainment with judicial review.
3. Third Offense: Detainment for a period not to exceed 90 days, subject to immediate and bi-weekly judicial review to ensure the detention remains necessary and proportionate to the public health threat.

- Billing and Enforcement: Subsequent to receiving care, the state health service shall issue an invoice to the individual for the full cost of treatment. This debt constitutes a legally enforceable obligation. The state may pursue collection through all lawful means, including the placement of liens on the individual's assets.

1. Judicial review within 72 hours of any detainment.
2. Citizens' Assembly may review all emergency measures.
3. Weekly reporting required to Congress on emergency powers usage.

### Section 9: Prohibition on Financial Conflicts of Interest

1. **The Principle of Undivided Loyalty:** Public office is a public trust. To ensure the undivided loyalty of elected officials and senior appointees, their personal financial interests must be separated from their power to shape law and policy.
2. **Mandatory Divestiture for Candidates:**
- Any person seeking election to a federal office within the Republic must, as a condition of their candidacy, divest themselves of all ownership in individual corporate stocks, bonds, and speculative financial instruments.
- This divestment must be completed and formally certified with the National Electoral Commission no less than 90 days before the election.

- All covered individuals shall file a full public financial disclosure upon declaring candidacy or being nominated.
- The National Electoral Commission (or equivalent body) shall have the authority to audit these disclosures and investigate potential violations.
6. **Penalty for Violation:** 
- Knowingly violating this section shall be a felony.
- Upon conviction, the office shall be deemed forfeit, the individual shall be permanently barred from future public office, and shall be subject to criminal penalties including imprisonment and the forfeiture of any illicit gains, in accordance with Article XII.

**Framer's Justification:** _You cannot serve two masters. This provision is the logical conclusion of the anti-corruption principles in Article XII. If an official can profit from their policy decisions, they are no longer a public servant but a legalized kleptocrat. This forces a clear choice: serve the public, or serve your portfolio. You cannot do both._

## ARTICLE VIII: THE SURGEON COURT

### Section 1: Establishment and Jurisdictional Hierarchy

1. The Surgeon Court is hereby established as the final and exclusive court of appeal for all matters of medical fact, , medical methodology, clinical efficacy, and public health science.
2. Its jurisdiction includes, but not limited to:
- The safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and treatment protocols.
- The definition of standard of care for medical conditions.
- The scientific basis for public health measures (e.g., the contagiousness of a pathogen, the efficacy of masks or vaccines).
- Questions of medical necessity and the appropriate application of specific medical interventions, including abortion and end-of-life care.
3. The Supreme Court remains the court of final appeal for all matters of constitutional law, fundamental rights, statutory interpretation, and all non-medical scientific and technical matters (e.g., climate science, engineering standards, forensic evidence standards).
4. The Supreme Court is expressly and absolutely forbidden from re-litigating or overturning a finding of medical fact or technical medical standard made by the Surgeon Court. The Surgeon Court's findings on these matters are final and binding on all other branches of government, including the Supreme Court.
5. All justices in this court is elected by certified medical doctors.

### Section 2: The "Settled Medical Law" Doctrine

1. Once the Surgeon Court establishes a medical fact (e.g, "Vaccine X is safe and effective for Population Y", "Procedure Z is the standard of care for Condition A"), this finding becomes a principle of Settled Medical Law.
2. Settled Medical Law is permanent. It cannot be ignored or overturned by any branch of government, including a future Surgeon Court.
3. The only exception is if new, overwhelming, and replicable medical evidence emerges that is accepted by the global medical community. A future Surgeon Court may then issue a new ruling that updates the scientific understanding, but it does not overturn the old one. The ruling is simply superseded by the new one.
4. The Constitutional Limitation:
- No finding of Settled Medical Law shall be interpreted or applied by any branch of government to justify a mandate prohibited under Article I, Section 5, Clause 5.
- The authority of the Surgeon Court is to establish medical fact for the purposes of informing public policy, guiding medical practice, and as evidence in legal proceedings. Its findings do not, in and of themselves, create a legal compulsion that overrides the fundamental right to Bodily Autonomy.

### Section 3: The Medical Referral Process

1. In any case before it, the Supreme Court shall identify any specific questions of medical fact that are necessary to resolve the constitutional dispute.
2. The Supreme Court shall issue a formal referral of those questions to the Surgeon Court for a binding finding.
3. The Surgeon Court shall conduct proceedings to establish the relevant medical facts and return a Binding Medical Finding to the Supreme Court.
4. The Supreme Court has no authority to question and shall render its judgement on the constitutional questions based upon it.

### Section 4: Resolution of Jurisdictional Disputes

1. A standing in Medical Jurisdiction Panel shall be established to resolve disputes over whether a question posed by the Supreme Court is one of pure medical fact (Surgeon Court) or non-medical fact/constitutional law (Supreme Court).
2. The Panel shall be composed of five members: two appointed by the Surgeon Court, two appointed by the Supreme Court, and a fifth chairperson who is a former Surgeon General or equivalent, voted for by certified medical doctors.
3. The Panel's sole task is to classify the referred question. Its decision, requiring a simple majority, is final.

---

## ARTICLE IX: THE HISTORIAN COURT

The Historian Court's job is to ensure the integrity of historical fact. Its powers and limitations are the same as the Surgeon Court, and is voted by certified historians.

### Section 1: Mandate and Jurisdictional Limit

1. The Historian Court is established as a tribunal of fact. Its sole mandate is to investigate and make findings on questions of historical and factual record referred to it by the Supreme Court pursuant to Article V, Section 6.
2. The Court's power of inquiry is strictly and exclusively limited to determining facts relevant to a potential violation of Article I, Section 5 (Safeguarding Democratic Integrity). It shall have no power to conduct open-ended inquiries or to define new categories of ineligibility.

### Section 2: The Article I Framework for Findings

1. In any proceeding before it, the Historian Court's central question must be framed with explicit reference to the rights defined in Article I. The question shall be:
  "Does the preponderance of the evidence—including public speeches, writings, associations, and actions—demonstrate that the individual in question adheres to an ideology or organization that explicitly advocates for the denial of one or more of the fundamental rights enumerated in Article I of this Constitution to any person or group based on a characteristic protected under Article I, Section 1?"
2. A "Finding of Fact" issued by the Court must specify:
- The specific clause(s) of Article I that the individual's ideology threatens.
- The specific group(s) or person(s) targeted for the denial of rights.
- The documented evidence (e.g., speeches, manifestos, membership) that forms the basis of the finding.

### Section 3: Composition and Ethical Safeguards

1.         The Court shall be composed of historians and legal scholars selected for their expertise in political history, ideology, and constitutional law. Justices shall be elected by a National Historical Assembly, constituted of all certified historians, using the peer-election model defined in Article IV, Section 8, to ensure the highest standards of professional rigor and impartiality.
2. Members of the Court are bound by a strict code of professional conduct. They must act as impartial investigators, not as advocates. Any finding must be based solely on the verifiable, public record.
3. Deliberations and the evidential record of the Court shall be a matter of public record, ensuring total transparency in its fact-finding process.

### Section 4: The Binding Finding and its Consequence

1. The Court's Finding of Fact is binding on the Supreme Court for the purpose of issuing a decree of Permanent Disqualification from Public Office under Article V, Section 6.
2. A finding may only be "Yes" or "No" to the question posed in Section 2.1. It shall contain no recommended punishment or political commentary.
3. A "Yes" finding demonstrates that the individual poses a clear and present danger to the constitutional order by seeking to use state power to dismantle its foundational rights. A "No" finding confirms that the individual's record, however controversial, does not meet this high and specific bar.

## ARTICLE X: TRANSITION JUSTICE AND SAFEGUARDS

1. Any grandfathered landlord or realtor found guilty of non-violent retaliation (e.g., fraudulent paperwork, economic harassment) shall immediately lose their grandfathered status. All their non-primary-residence properties shall revert to the Public Housing Trust.

### Section 4: Diminished Defense for Phased-Out Professions

1. In any criminal proceeding against an individual for acts committed in the course of operating a business or practice that is being phased out or prohibited under this Constitution (including, but not limited to, grandfathered residential landlordship or realty), the fact that the act was committed for commercial gain shall not be considered a mitigating factor.
2. Conversely, such commercial motivation shall be considered an aggravating factor, as it demonstrates a deliberate choice to prioritize personal profit over compliance with the constitutional order and the public good. This aggravation of penalties shall apply to crimes including fraud, intimidation, harassment, destruction of property, and violence.

---

## ARTICLE XI: NATIONAL SECURITY

### Section 1: Digital Integrity of Government and Financial Devices

1. The installation of foreign software, unless fully open source to be verifiable, is forbidden on all state/provincial and federal devices.
2. Every server is to utilize a fork OpenBSD or better. By better, this Article means faster for the same security. It does not need any graphical applications.
3. Desktop computers and government issued mobile phones are to use a fork of FreeBSD. Prioritize the Wayland protocol.
4. An agency that deals with software security shall come together and write an anti-virus, firewall, and a software sandbox written in SPARK. This suit of software shall be open source for civilian use. All network drivers are to be facilitated for SPARK programming.
5. In the meantime, that agency should conduct a team of developers to explore the Zig programming language for baremetal programming, with anything non baremetal handled by Rust programmers. Prioritize a framekernel build for enhance security, and conduct audits the same way as OpenBSD.
6. Utilize the RISC-V architecture once it is stabilized. Given it's open nature, apply encryption.

---

## ARTICLE XII: ACCOUNTABILITY OF AUTHORITY FIGURES

### Section 1: Penalties for Corruption

1. All elected officials are subject to life in prison for corruption and for violating constitutional rights.

### Section 2: Limitation on Pardons

1. There is no possibility of pardons for the offenses in Section 1. Only exoneration based on new evidence is valid.

### Section 3: The Anti-Corruption "Poisoned Chalice" Provision

1. Legal Acceptance as Enforcement Action: A public official shall incur no criminal liability for retaining an item of value offered as a bribe, provided the official's actions are conducted in strict compliance with the authorized procedures stipulated in Clause 2 of this Section. In such cases, the act of retention is classified as a lawful component of an anti-corruption enforcement action.
2. Mandatory Protocol for Officials: Upon being offered a bribe, a public official is legally obligated to adhere to the following procedure:
- Immediate Securement and Notification: The official must promptly secure the item of value and report the incident to a designated independent anti-corruption authority.
- Declarative Acceptance: The official must formally notify the briber, in a manner documented by authorities (e.g., recorded communication), that the payment is being accepted as evidence pursuant to this constitutional provision and will be retained by the official as a lawful penalty against the briber.
- Full Cooperation: The official must provide complete and truthful cooperation in the subsequent investigation and legal proceedings against the briber.
3. Criminal Liability of the Briber and Asset Forfeiture: The act of offering or conferring a bribe constitutes a felony. Upon the official's full compliance with Clause 2, the item of value is immediately forfeited by the briber.
- Valuation and Escrow: The asset shall be promptly appraised by a state-appointed authority. Its fair market value shall be calculated, and the sum shall be transferred to the official. In strict accordance to Article XI, Section 4, this sum shall be placed into the official's state-managed escrow account, to be accessed only upon their lawful departure from office.
- Disposition of Physical Asset: The physical asset itself (e.g., cash, property, valuables) shall be sold at public auction or converted to state use. The proceeds from such sale shall be deposited into the Public Housing Trust.
4. Penalties for Bribery: Conviction for offering a bribe shall carry a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty (20) years imprisonment, without eligibility for parole. The fact that the briber also suffered the additional penalty of asset forfeiture to the official shall not be considered mitigation during sentencing.
5. Penalty for Official Misconduct: Any public official who accepts a bribe and willfully fails to comply with the mandatory protocol in Clause 2 shall be prosecuted for corruption under Article VIII, Section 1, subject to life imprisonment or death. As a tighter measure, chemically induced executions will be permitted for this specific scenario due to their unpredictable nature.

### Section 4: Elimination of Financial Incentive for Public Service

1. Principle: To eliminate financial motivation for corruption and ensure that public service is driven by duty and not personal gain, the financial compensation for all elected officials shall be structured as follows.
2. In-Office Support System:
- Accommodation and Sustenance: The state shall provide all elected officials and their immediate families with secure, high-quality accommodation and up to three nutritious meals per day, available without charge at designated facilities throughout the Republic for the duration of their term.
- Official Expenses: All reasonable costs associated with the execution of their official duties, including travel, security, and communications, shall be borne by the state.
3. Deferred Compensation Model:
- Escrow of Earnings: One hundred percent of an elected official's monetary salary and any other state-provided monetary allowances shall be placed into a secure, state-managed escrow account. The official shall have no access to these funds during their term in office.
- Release of Funds: The entire deferred compensation, with accrued interest, shall be released to the official in a lump sum upon their lawful departure from office, provided they have not been impeached and convicted for corruption or a related offense.
- Forfeiture for Corruption: Any official impeached and convicted for corruption, bribery, or embezzlement shall permanently forfeit their entire escrowed earnings to the Public Housing Trust.
4. Purpose and Intent: This system is designed to ensure that individuals seeking public office are motivated by a commitment to public welfare, not financial enrichment. By separating the official from direct monetary gain during their service, the state removes a primary vector for corruption and reinforces the principle that public office is a public trust.

### Section 5: The Crime of Political Subversion by Detention

1. The Offense: It is a supreme offense against the state, punishable by death, for any public official to knowingly, and with malicious intent to subvert the democratic process, order the arrest or detention of a political official for the sole purpose of terminating a lawful parliamentary tactic.
2. Definition of Lawful Tactic: For the purpose of this section, "lawful parliamentary tactic" is strictly defined as:
- The denial of a quorum.
- The use of a filibuster or other recognized delaying procedure.
- A vote against government business.
- It shall not include incitement to violence, sedition, or any other criminal act.
3. Standard of Proof: Conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of specific malicious intent. The prosecution must demonstrate that the official acted not to enforce general law, but specifically to break a lawful political stalemate.
4. Liability: The official who gives the order bears ultimate responsibility. Officials who carry out the order may be prosecuted as accomplices if they knowingly participate in the unlawful scheme, all punishable by up to life in prison with no possibiltity of parole or pardon.

2. Its mandate is the preservation of the State, the defense of its territory, and the execution of lawful orders from the civilian government.
3. Recognizing that the requirements of discipline, unity, and operational effectiveness in combat are incompatible with the full exercise of certain civilian rights, the provisions of this Article shall constitute a necessary and lawful exception to the rights enumerated in Article I for all persons in the Defense Force.

### Section 2: Suspension of Rights During Service

Upon voluntary enlistment or conscription, and for the duration of their service, members of the Defense Force shall be subject to the following modifications of their constitutional rights:

1. Modification of Free Expression (Art. I, Sec. 3):
- The right to criticize command decisions, strategy, or the political leadership in a public forum is suspended. Speech that undermines unit cohesion, discipline, or morale is prohibited and subject to court-martial.
- There shall be no right to press access for embedded journalists without command authorization. All military communications are subject to monitoring and censorship for operational security.
2. Suspension of Digital Privacy & Autonomy (Art. I, Sec. 7):
- There shall be no expectation of privacy in personal digital data, communications, or online activity while using government systems or networks, or when such activity is conducted on-base.
- Bulk data collection of personnel communications for the purposes of force protection and counter-intelligence is expressly permitted.
3. Modification of the Right to Bear Arms (Art. I, Sec. 9):
- The individual right to personally select, acquire, and possess arms is suspended. The bearing of arms is a duty, not a right, and is strictly controlled by the chain of command. Weapons are the property of the State, issued for specific duties and missions.
4. Suspension of Domestic Privacy (Art. I, Sec. 10):
- The right to privacy within one's lawful residence is suspended for on-base housing. Quarters are subject to inspection at any time, with or without cause, by order of a commissioned or non-commissioned officer to ensure discipline, safety, and readiness.
5. Conditional Suspension of Bodily Autonomy (Art. I, Sec. 5):
- The absolute prohibition on mandated medical treatment is suspended. Members may be required to receive vaccinations, prophylactic medications, and other medical treatments deemed necessary for force health protection and operational readiness by the Surgeon General.
- The right to refuse an order based on a medical mandate is not recognized and is grounds for court-martial.

### Section 3: The Military Justice System

1. A separate system of military courts, known as courts-martial, shall be established to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
2. Rights within this system are modified:
- The right to a trial by a jury of one's peers (Art. II, Sec. 1) is replaced by the right to a court-martial panel composed of commissioned officers and/or senior non-commissioned officers.
- The right to a speedy trial is retained, but its definition may be adjusted for operational deployments.
- Protections against self-incrimination are maintained, but the consequences of remaining silent in the face of a direct, lawful order to answer questions are distinct from civilian practice.

### Section 4: Accountability and Restoration of Rights

1. The enhanced penalties for official misconduct (Art. II, Sec. 3) apply with greater force to officers of the Defense Force who abuse the authority granted in this Article.
2. All rights suspended or modified under this Article are fully restored upon the member's receipt of an Honorable, General (under honorable conditions), or Other Than Honorable discharge from the Defense Force. A Dishonorable Discharge or a Bad Conduct Discharge (as a result of a court-martial) shall be considered a waiver of these rights until such time as the individual's civil rights are formally restored by a civilian court.
3. Any member subjected to a court-martial conviction may, upon discharge, petition the civilian Supreme Court for a review of their case on the grounds of a fundamental miscarriage of justice, ensuring a final check by the civilian branch.

## ARTICLE XV: EDUCATION

### Section 1: The Purpose of Education

The primary purpose of public education in the Secular Democratic Republic is to empower every citizen with the knowledge, skills, and critical faculties necessary for personal flourishing, effective participation in civic life, and the vigilant defense of liberty. Education shall be oriented towards creating a sovereign, informed, and skeptical citizenry capable of self-governance.

### Section 2: A Guaranteed Foundation

1. The state shall guarantee a high-quality, free public education from early childhood through the completion of secondary education.
2. The curriculum shall prioritize universal proficiency in essential tools of knowledge:
- **Literacy:** The ability to read complex texts with comprehension, analyze arguments, and communicate effectively in writing and speech.
- **Numeracy & Mathematical Reasoning:** A strong foundation in mathematics, logic, and statistical reasoning necessary for personal finance, technical careers, and evaluating quantitative claims in public discourse.
3. Mastery of these foundational skills is the non-negotiable first priority of the education system.

### Section 3: Civic and Critical Competency

Upon the foundation of literacy and numeracy, the education system shall instill:

1. **Civic Literacy:** A comprehensive understanding of this Constitution, the structure of government, history, and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.
2. **Critical Media and Digital Literacy:** Mandatory instruction, developed in consultation with the Scientific and Historian Branches, in:
- Identifying logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and rhetorical manipulation.
- Analyzing sources for credibility, bias, and evidence.
- Recognizing the techniques and purposes of propaganda, misinformation, and synthetic media.
3. **Financial and Economic Literacy:** Practical understanding of personal finance, economic principles, and the rights of workers and consumers as defined in Article III.

### Section 4: Secular and Neutral Public Education

1. Public educational institutions and their curricula shall be strictly secular. No religious doctrine shall form any part of the curriculum.
2. The educational environment shall be one of free inquiry and intellectual neutrality. Teachers shall act as facilitators of critical thinking, not advocates for any political party or ideological orthodoxy.

### Section 5: The Right to Repair Educational Deficits

1. Recognizing that a failed education is a deprivation of a fundamental right, any adult citizen who did not receive an adequate education as defined in this Article shall have the right to free, state-provided remedial education to achieve functional literacy, numeracy, and civic competency.

**Framer's Justification:** _A republic is a machine that must be run by its citizens. If the citizens are uneducated, the machine will break. This Article ensures the system creates its own best operators. We prioritize math and reading not as ends in themselves, but as the indispensable keys to unlocking all other knowledge and defending oneself against tyranny. By guaranteeing these skills, we make the promises of Bodily Autonomy and Free Expression meaningful, for a right you are not educated enough to understand or defend is a right in name only._

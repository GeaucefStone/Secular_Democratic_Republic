## The Scene

**(The scene opens with CALEB packing his notes at a podium, his face tight with anger.)**

**CALEB:** This isn't over. The system might protect you now, but we will find a way. We will protect our communities from the danger. Mark my words.

**(ALEX steps onto an adjacent platform, holding their own personal, worn copy of the Bible and a 12-gauge shotgun.)**

**ALEX:** Your words are a veil, Caleb! This wasn't about safety! This was about using the state to render my friends and family **easy targets**! You wanted to strip them of the means of self-defense, all for the sake of the hateful doctrines in this book!

**(The crowd reacts with gasps and murmurs. Camera lights flash. OFFICER MILLER stands alert, hand resting on her duty belt, assessing the situation calmly.)**

**CALEB:** (Smirking) Go on, blaspheme. Show everyone your true, violent nature. The cameras are rolling.

**(ALEX turns and walks to a pre-inspected, certified safe backstop area—a large earthen berm at the edge of the square specifically designated for such demonstrations. They face completely away from the crowd and buildings.)**

**ALEX:** (Shouting to the crowd) I do not recognize the authority of this text to dictate the rights of my friends! I reject its bigotry! And I will exercise **my** rights to prove that in this Republic, we are all sovereign!

**(ALEX loads a single shell, raises the shotgun, and fires. The BLAST echoes through the square. The Bible is obliterated against the earthen berm. Paper scraps flutter to the ground. ALEX breaks the shotgun, the spent shell ejecting, and places the safe, open weapon on the ground.)**

**(A stunned silence grips the crowd, then breaks into agitated murmuring. CALEB looks triumphant. OFFICER MILLER approaches methodically.)**

**CALEB:** (To Officer Miller) Arrest that maniac! Incitement! Terrorism! Blasphemy!

**OFFICER MILLER:** (Ignores Caleb, speaks to Alex in a calm, professional tone) Sir/Ma'am, your firearm is secure?

**ALEX:** (Nods) It's safe. Ejected, open, and empty.

**OFFICER MILLER:** (Checks the weapon visually, then nods. She pulls out a department-issue tablet.) Very well. I need to see your firearms license. The demonstration was powerful, but the municipal code, Section 12-4.7, prohibits the discharge of a firearm within 500 yards of a public park without a special event permit. This square is designated as a public park. I am issuing you a citation for unlawful discharge. The fine is 250 credits. You can contest it in municipal court.

**(CALEB's jaw drops in disbelief.)**

**CALEB:** THAT'S IT?! A TICKET?! He just desecrated a holy book! He fired a weapon!

**OFFICER MILLER:** (Turns to Caleb, her tone neutral and firm) Officer Miller, badge 7413. The individual destroyed their own personal property as a form of political expression, which is protected under Article One, Section Three. The method violated a municipal discharge ordinance, which I have enforced. There is no law against "blasphemy" in this Republic. The matter is closed.

**(ALEX accepts the ticket, a faint, resolved smile on their face.)**

**ALEX:** I'll pay the fine. The message was worth the price.

**(OFFICER MILLER turns back to CALEB, her gaze sharpening.)**

**OFFICER MILLER:** As for you, Mr. Caleb. Your public statements today, and now your demand for the arrest of a citizen for a constitutionally protected act, have been noted. A petition is being prepared for the Historian Court. Your ideology, which seeks to deny fundamental rights to a protected class, has been demonstrated clearly. I suggest you retain a lawyer. Your career in public office is likely over.

**(The scene holds on CALEB's face, which cycles through emotions: first triumph, then confusion, then dawning horror as he comprehends the true, unforgiving nature of the system he tried to manipulate. The system protected the very act he found most despicable, and is now turning its full, meticulous power upon him.)**

**FADE TO BLACK.**

## Constitutional Analysis

### Protected Actions:

1. **Alex's Speech & Symbolic Protest:** Fully protected under Article I, Section 3. The destruction of personal property for political expression is recognized as symbolic speech.

2. **Firearm Possession:** Alex's licensed ownership and use of the shotgun was legal under Article I, Section 10.

### Violations & Enforcement:

1. **Municipal Discharge Violation:** Alex received a appropriate, proportional citation for violating local discharge regulations permitted under Article I, Section 10, Clause 7.

2. **Constitutional Violation by Caleb:** His advocacy for denying fundamental rights to a protected class (trans people) and his attempt to use state power to punish protected speech triggers Article I, Section 5 and the disqualification process under Article V, Section 6.

### Legal Outcome:

 - **Alex:** Pays a 250-credit fine for a municipal violation.

 - **Caleb:** Faces permanent disqualification from public office through the Historian Court process.

 - **The System:** Functioned as designed - protecting unpopular speech while enforcing neutral public safety laws, and disqualifying officials who seek to undermine fundamental rights.

**Scene Status:** Demonstrates the practical application of multiple constitutional provisions in a high-tension scenario.

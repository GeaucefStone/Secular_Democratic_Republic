# THE QUARANTINE DILEMMA

**A SCENARIO IN ONE ACT**

### CHARACTERS

- **JUDGE ELARA VANCE** (50s): A Public Health Court judge, weary but meticulous.
- **DAVID KENSINGTON** (40s): A businessman, charismatic, used to being in control.
- **DR. ISHANI PATEL** (30s): A public health official, holding a tablet filled with data.

### SETTING

A sterile, modern courtroom. Large screens display charts and timelines. Judge Vance sits elevated, reviewing a digital dossier. Dr. Patel stands at the prosecution table. David Kensington stands confidently at the defense table, without a lawyer.

---

**(The scene opens as Judge Vance looks up from her screen, her gaze settling on Kensington.)**

**JUDGE VANCE**
Mr. Kensington. The record shows this is your fifth appearance before this court for violations of the Pandemic Response Act. You've had a warning, a 14-day protective detainment, a 90-day detainment, and now stand convicted of a fourth violation. The state has proven you knowingly broke quarantine while infectious. Again.

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
(Smiling, charming)
Your Honor, with all due respect, it's a ridiculous charge. I was just checking on my employees. Leadership, you know? Can't run a business from a cage. The economy doesn't stop for a virus.

**JUDGE VANCE**
The "cage" was a state-funded isolation facility, following your second and third infections. Dr. Patel, the impact statement.

**(Dr. Patel steps forward, her voice calm and precise.)**

**DR. PATEL**
Your Honor, the defendant's actions are a textbook case of reckless endangerment. Contact tracing links his fourth infection to 17 secondary cases. Three of those individuals are now in the ICU. One, a 68-year-old man named Arthur Finley, is on a ventilator. The cost of his care, to the state, currently exceeds 400,000 credits.

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
(Waving a hand dismissively)
A tragedy, truly. But that's what hospitals are for. It's not my fault the man was elderly. My body, my choice, right? That's in the constitution. Article... something.

**JUDGE VANCE**
(Her voice becomes dangerously quiet)
**Article I, Section 6**. The right to refuse a *medical intervention*. Not the right to be a biological weapon. The court finds you guilty on all counts.

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
(Scoffs)
Fine. A fine, I assume. Let's get on with it. I have a board meeting at three.

**JUDGE VANCE**
There is no fine, Mr. Kensington. A fourth violation is a felony. The mandatory sentence is ten years imprisonment, to be followed by a minimum of five years of probation.

**(Kensington's smile vanishes. He stares, uncomprehending.)**

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
Ten... years? For having a cough? You can't be serious. This is insane!

**JUDGE VANCE**
I have not yet reached the most significant part of the sentencing, Mr. Kensington. And I strongly suggest you listen carefully to what comes next, because your next violation will be your last. Dr. Patel, if you would.

**(Dr. Patel taps her tablet. A new document appears on the main screen.)**

**DR. PATEL**
Pursuant to **Article VI, Section 6, Clause 6** of the Constitution: the Full-Cost Liability for Reckless Endangerment.

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
Liability? What liability?

**DR. PATEL**
The clause states that any individual convicted of a fourth or subsequent offense during a public health emergency shall be fully and solely financially liable for one hundred percent of the costs associated with any medical treatment they necessitate.

**JUDGE VANCE**
The state provided Mr. Finley with the full and complete standard of care, as guaranteed. However, the state's subsidy for that care is revoked for you. Upon your release from prison, you will be invoiced for the full cost of the medical treatment resulting from your actions.

**(Kensington's face pales. He leans on the table for support.)**

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
Four... four hundred thousand credits? I don't... My business... that will bankrupt me!

**JUDGE VANCE**
The financial liability is not limited to Mr. Finley. It extends to all 17 individuals you infected. Their testing, their treatments, their lost wages covered by the state's sick-leave fund. The total preliminary estimate is 1.2 million credits.

**(Kensington sinks into his chair, utterly defeated.)**

**JUDGE VANCE**
(Leans forward, her gaze intense)
But I need you to understand something, Mr. Kensington. Look at me.

**(He forces himself to meet her eyes.)**

**JUDGE VANCE**
This is your fourth strike. Under **Article VI, Section 6, Clause 5**, a fifth violation is punishable by life imprisonment, with parole eligibility determined after a minimum of 25 years served. Not ten years. Not with probation. Life.

She lets the word hang in the air.

**JUDGE VANCE**
The next time you decide that the rules don't apply to you, the next time you treat a public health order as a minor inconvenience, it will not be my courtroom you leave in handcuffs. It will be a prison cell you leave in a coffin. Do you understand the finality of that?

**DAVID KENSINGTON**
(A shattered whisper)
Yes, Your Honor.

**JUDGE VANCE**
You believed "my body, my choice" was a slogan of absolute personal freedom without social responsibility. The Constitution you so casually invoked disagrees. It recognizes that one person's freedom ends where another person's safety begins. You made a choice. These are the consequences. This court is adjourned.

**(The gavel falls. The sound echoes in the silent room. David Kensington does not look up, staring at the figure on the screen—a debt he can never repay, and a warning he can no longer ignore.)**

**FADE TO BLACK.**

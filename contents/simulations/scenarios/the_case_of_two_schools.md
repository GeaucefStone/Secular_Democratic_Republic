# Constitutional Crisis: The Case of the Two Schools
_A Scenario of Secular Enforcement_

## THE SETTING

The town of Liberty Falls is a quiet, conservative community. For generations, the local public high school, Liberty Falls High, has begun each day with a prayer and a Bible verse read over the intercom. It's "just tradition," everyone says.

The SDR Constitution has been ratified for three years. The new systems are in place, but in towns like Liberty Falls, old habits die hard.

## THE CHARACTERS

-   **PRINCIPAL GEORGE ABERNATHY:** A third-generation principal at Liberty Falls High. He sees the morning prayer as his duty and a cornerstone of the community's moral fiber.
-   **MAYOR DIANA REID:** Popular, pragmatic, and afraid of upsetting her voter base. She has quietly instructed the city attorney to "look the other way" on the school prayer issue.
-   **MS. ANITA SHARMA:** A new biology teacher and a recent graduate from a university where the SDR principles were taught. She is a secularist and a believer in the new constitutional order.
-   **MR. LUCIFER BLACK:** A representative of The Satanic Temple's local chapter. Sharp, media-savvy, and a constitutional literalist.

## THE CRISIS UNFOLDS

### Act I: The Complaint

**Monday, 8:05 AM:** Ms. Sharma, frustrated after the morning prayer interrupts her lesson prep, uses the official SDR government portal on her phone. She files a formal complaint with the **Citizens' Branch**, citing a violation of **Article I, Section 2**.

By noon, the automated systems of the Citizens' Branch have logged the complaint, assigned it a case number, and notified the Liberty Falls city government.

### Act II: The Stonewall

**Tuesday:** Mayor Reid receives the notification. She calls Principal Abernathy.

**REID:** "It's just Sharma, that new teacher. Don't worry about it, George. It's a local matter. We handle it."

The city sends a pro-forma response to the Citizens' Branch: "The matter is under internal review. The described activity is a long-standing community tradition, not a formal religious endorsement."

The morning prayer continues.

### Act III: The Test

**Two Weeks Later:** A sleek, black van pulls up in a vacant lot directly across from Liberty Falls High. A sign is erected:

> **THE SATANIC TEMPLE ACADEMY OF LIBERTY FALLS**
> _Applications Now Open for a Constitutionally-Sound Education_
> (A Private Religious School - Art. I, Sec. 2, Clause 3)

Mr. Black holds a press conference on the sidewalk.

**BLACK:** "We are thrilled to open our doors in this wonderful community. We believe in the robust application of the SDR Constitution. Since the public school across the street has become a *de facto* Christian institution, we are simply providing an alternative for those who seek a truly diverse, pluralistic environment. Our morning announcements will include a reading from the Satanic Bible."

The town erupts. The national media descends.

### Act IV: The Constitutional Immune System Activates

The establishment of the Satanic Temple school acts as a catalyst, triggering multiple branches of government simultaneously.

1.  **The Citizens' Branch:** The original complaint, now combined with hundreds of new ones from outraged parents on *both* sides, is escalated. A sortition-selected investigative committee is formed. They issue a subpoena to Mayor Reid and Principal Abernathy.

2.  **The Judicial Branch:** The state Attorney General, witnessing the blatant violation and the ensuing chaos, files a lawsuit against the City of Liberty Falls for failure to uphold its constitutional duty.

3.  **The Historian Court:** The Supreme Court, seeking an unassailable factual basis for its ruling, refers a key question to the Historian Court:
    > "Does the preponderance of historical evidence demonstrate that the consistent integration of a specific religion's prayers into the daily operations of a public school constitutes an establishment and endorsement of that religion?"

    The Historian Court's Binding Finding returns in 48 hours: **"Yes."**

### Act V: The Reckoning

A joint hearing is held. Mayor Reid and Principal Abernathy sit before the Citizens' Branch committee.

**CHAIRPERSON (a retired plumber from the other side of the country):** "Mayor Reid, the Constitution is clear. Your duty was clear. You chose not to act. Why?"

**REID:** "I was representing the will of my community!"

**CHAIRPERSON:** "Your community is the Secular Democratic Republic. Its will is this document."

The committee votes. With an 75% majority, they initiate impeachment proceedings against Mayor Reid for dereliction of constitutional duty.

Simultaneously, the Supreme Court, armed with the Historian Court's finding, issues a nationwide writ: *All religious practices in public schools must cease immediately.*

## THE AFTERMATH

-   **Mayor Diana Reid** is impeached and removed from office.
-   **Principal George Abernathy** is forced into early retirement.
-   **The morning prayer** at Liberty Falls High ends the next day.
-   **The Satanic Temple Academy,** its point made and its legal costs covered by a victory in a subsequent civil rights suit, quietly closes its location a semester later. They issue a statement: "Our purpose was to prove that the law must apply equally to all. The SDR's constitutional mechanisms, while slow to start, proved robust. Our work here is done."

_The "Case of the Two Schools" becomes a landmark textbook example. It demonstrates that the SDR's defense of liberty is not passive—it is a proactive, multi-branched system designed to force compliance through a series of inescapable legal and political pressures. The Satanic Temple didn't win the argument in the town square; they triggered the constitutional machine, and the machine did the rest._

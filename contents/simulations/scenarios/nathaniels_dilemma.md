## SCENE START

[VISUAL: Clean interface, constitutional text visible in sidebar]

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Initial engagement. Subject Nathaniel employs Common Rhetorical Strategy 1: The Conflation Pattern.

**NATHANIEL**
This country was founded on Christian principles. The SDR's "secularism" is just a fancy word for attacking our way of life. We need to return to God's law.

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Protocol 1: Factual Calibration. The SDR Constitution Article 1, Section 2 establishes no official religion. This ensures all citizens, of any faith or none, have equal standing before the law.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Note the immediate anchoring in constitutional text. No emotional engagement, only factual calibration.

**NATHANIEL**
Equal standing? What about MY rights? My religious freedom? You're silencing me!

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Your religious freedom is protected under Article 1, Section 3. You may worship as you choose. What is not protected is using state power to impose your religious practices on others.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Subject shifts to CRS-3: Motive Attribution. Supporter maintains protocol, distinguishing between private belief and public power.

**NATHANIEL**
Impose? We're talking about saving souls! About preventing the moral collapse you see all around us. Your "neutrality" is just cowardice.

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
The state's role is to protect rights, not souls. Article 1, Section 1 guarantees equal protection regardless of religious belief. A theocracy would violate this guarantee for millions of citizens.

**NATHANIEL**
So you're saying my deeply held religious beliefs are "unconstitutional"?

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Your beliefs are protected. Your political program to establish a state religion is what Article 1, Section 5 identifies as incompatible with democratic office.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Critical distinction made. The system does not regulate belief, only the use of state power.

**NATHANIEL**
This is exactly what I mean! You've created a system where faithful Christians can't even run for office unless we abandon our core beliefs!

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Many Christians serve in the SDR government. They simply uphold their oath to the Constitution rather than seeking to replace it with religious law. There's a fundamental difference.

**NATHANIEL**
And what if our religious law IS our core belief? What if we believe Leviticus 20:13 is God's eternal truth?

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Then you may believe that in your church and your home. But Article 1, Section 1 guarantees that no citizen shall face violence or discrimination for their sexual orientation or gender identity. Your religious freedom ends where another citizen's right to life begins.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
The fundamental conflict is now explicit. Constitutional rights versus religious supremacy.

**NATHANIEL**
So you're saying God's law is subordinate to your man-made constitution?

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
In the civic sphere, yes. The constitution is the foundational agreement among all citizens of diverse beliefs. Your freedom to practice your religion depends on this same principle protecting you from others imposing their beliefs on you.

**NATHANIEL**
What good is "saving my soul" if I only pretend to believe? If I can't live my faith in public life?

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
You can live your faith. You can't weaponize the state to force others to live by it. There's a difference between personal conviction and state coercion.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Subject attempts theological argument. Supporter maintains civic framework.

**NATHANIEL**
You're creating a country where the most important truths can't be spoken! Where we have to hide our faith like a dirty secret!

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
The Constitution protects your right to speak these "truths." What it doesn't allow is transforming them into law that would execute or oppress your fellow citizens. That's not "hiding faith" - that's preventing theocracy.

**NATHANIEL**
So an Islamist who wants Sharia law gets the same speech rights as me?

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
Exactly the same. And he would be equally barred from imposing it. The Constitution is ideologically blind. Article 1, Section 5 applies equally to all who seek to replace constitutional democracy with religious rule.

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Checkmate achieved. The system's neutrality becomes its ultimate strength.

**NATHANIEL**
That makes you no better than them! You're just another kind of fundamentalist!

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
We're fundamentalist about one thing: equal protection under law. Your ideology is not a competing political view; it is a threat to the life and liberty of citizens. The constitution is designed to be militantly intolerant of that threat.

**NATHANIEL**
You can't...

**SDR_SUPPORTER**
You are free to save your own soul. You are not free to create a state that pretends to save mine at the point of a sword.

[VISUAL: Nathaniel's cursor blinks. No response comes.]

**ANALYST (V.O.)**
Terminal discursive engagement reached. The constitutional logic is complete and inescapable. All rhetorical paths exhausted.

[FADE TO Nathaniel's physical reaction as previous script]

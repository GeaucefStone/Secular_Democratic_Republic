## THE STERLING DILEMMA

**A SCENARIO IN ONE ACT**

### CHARACTERS

- **PASTOR JEREMIAH STERLING** (50s-60s): Charismatic, fiery, a leader. The shepherd of The Rock of Salvation Megachurch.
- **BROTHER MICHAEL** (20s): Zealous, idealistic, a true believer in Sterling and his cause.

### SETTING

The stage is a simple office, austere but for a large, ornate cross on the wall. The remnants of a fiery sermon cling to Pastor Sterling—a sheen of sweat, a loosened collar. Brother Michael stands before him, electric with adrenaline.

**(The scene opens moments after the sermon. The echo of the amens has faded.)**

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
(Bursting into the office)
Pastor! That was… that was prophecy! You tore the veil away! They're talking about it online. They're calling it "The Unveiling"!

**PASTOR STERLING**
(Wiping his brow with a handkerchief)
We spoke the truth, Michael. Nothing more. And nothing less.

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
It's more than that! This is it, Pastor! The line is drawn. You've given us the language, the fire! We have to take this to the next level. We can't just preach about it. We have to fight it. In the arena!

**PASTOR STERLING**
The arena?

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
The political arena! We'll start a movement. "Take Back the Republic!" We'll rally behind you. You'll run for the Legislative Congress! You can be our voice on the inside. You can expose them, propose laws, overturn this… this godless tyranny from within!

(Michael beams, envisioning the crusade. Sterling does not smile. A cold, heavy silence fills the room. The fire from the pulpit drains from his eyes, replaced by a dawning, bitter realization.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
(Voice is quiet, flat)
I cannot.

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
What? Why? Of course you can! You're a native-born citizen! You have every right! You're educated, you're eloquent, you're a leader! The people would follow you!

**PASTOR STERLING**
No, Michael. I don't have the right. Don't you see? That is their most brilliant, and most diabolical, cage.

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
(A flicker of confusion, then defiance)
What cage? The constitution guarantees the right to run for office! It's right there in—

**PASTOR STERLING**
(Interrupting, his voice sharpening)
Read it. Read **Article I, Section 5**. "Safeguarding Democratic Integrity." Then read **Article V, Section 6**. "Disqualification for Anti-Democratic Activity."

(He turns and looks at the cross on the wall, as if addressing it rather than Michael.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
My entire life's work… this sermon tonight… where I called their constitution a "false god," a "satanic doctrine," a "tower of Babel"… where I declared my unwavering loyalty to a Kingdom not of this world and a Law higher than theirs…

(He turns back to Michael, his face a mask of grim irony.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
…it was all a public hearing. I was providing the evidence for my own permanent disqualification. I have, by my own words, demonstrated a "sustained adherence to an ideology that advocates for the abolition of democratic institutions." Theirs.

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
(Stammering, the foundation of his world cracking)
But… that's… that's insane! That's your faith! They can't punish you for your faith!

**PASTOR STERLING**
They're not. They are defending their state from my political ideology. They have drawn a line, and I have proudly stood on the other side of it. I can be a citizen. I can pay taxes. I can even, for now, preach in this building.

(He takes a step closer, his voice dropping to a devastating whisper.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
But I can never be a Congressperson. I can never be President. I can never sit on their Supreme Court. I cannot even be a low-level bureaucrat with a shred of real authority. I am constitutionally destined to be a permanent protester. A permanent outsider, shouting at the walls of a fortress that was specifically designed to be soundproof against my voice.

**BROTHER MICHAEL**
(Shell-shocked)
So… we are… prisoners?

**PASTOR STERLING**
Worse. We are… neutralized.

(Sterling looks at the young man's shattered expression. The final, cruelest cut of all occurs to him.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
And it doesn't just stop me, Michael. It shatters us. It tells every bright, ambitious young man or woman in this congregation—everyone like you—that if you want a future, if you want to shape this world, you must make a choice.

(He lets the weight of his next words hang in the air.)

**PASTOR STERLING**
You can have your faith. Or you can have your political future. But you cannot have both. It breaks the chain of succession. It guarantees our ideology will never have a seat at the table. We will forever be on the menu.

(Brother Michael stares, his crusade crumbling before it even began. The silence in the office is no longer just an absence of sound, but the presence of a perfect, constitutional defeat.)

**FADE TO BLACK.**

## SYLLABUS

A municipal ordinance that effectively prohibits the discharge of firearms for recreational purposes on standard suburban residential lots through stringent, objective safety standards is a constitutional regulation that balances the right to bear arms and domestic privacy against the state's compelling interest in public safety. Such regulations are a valid exercise of the state's police power and do not constitute an infringement when they target the dangerous externalities of an activity, not the core right itself.

## OPINION OF THE COURT

**CHIEF JUSTICE STONE** delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case presents a conflict at the intersection of three fundamental rights: the right to bear arms, the right to domestic privacy and security, and the state's duty to protect public safety. We are asked to determine whether a local government may regulate the discharge of firearms in densely populated residential areas where the exercise of one right directly threatens the core of another.

### I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Municipality of Oakwood Heights, a suburban community with an average lot size of one-quarter acre, enacted Ordinance 42.1, the "Public Safety Discharge Act." The ordinance mandates that any discharge of a firearm within municipal limits requires an unimpeachable ballistic backstop and a minimum 300-yard safety radius free of occupied dwellings, with written consent from all property owners within that radius.

Respondent Elias Vance, a resident of Oakwood Heights, was cited for violating Ordinance 42.1 after regularly engaging in target practice with a 9mm pistol in his backyard, which measures 60 by 40 feet. His backstop consisted of a railroad tie backed by a small earth berm.

Vance defended his actions by invoking his fundamental rights under Article I, Section 10 (Right to Bear Arms) and Article I, Section 11 (Right to Domestic Privacy). He argued that the ordinance constitutes a de facto ban on a lawful activity within the "immediate grounds" of his residence, thus infringing upon both his right to use his arms and his autonomy within his private domain. The Municipal Court upheld the ordinance and the fine. The Appellate Division reversed, finding the ordinance's effect was to nullify the right for most residents. We granted certiorari.

### II. ANALYSIS

#### A. The Conflict of Fundamental Rights Requires a Balancing Test

The respondent correctly asserts two foundational rights. Article I, Section 10 guarantees the right to bear arms for self-defense and other lawful purposes, including proficiency training. Article I, Section 11 guarantees the right to privacy and autonomy within one's lawful residence and its immediate grounds.

However, these rights are not without limit. Article I, Section 4 provides the framework for resolving such conflicts, requiring the Court to seek a resolution that minimizes impairment to both rights and to consider the vulnerability of the parties and the availability of reasonable alternatives.

Here, the respondent's exercise of his rights under Section 10 and 11 directly and physically impinges upon his neighbors' identical right to domestic privacy and security under Section 11. The sound and potential hazard of gunfire shatter the "reasonable expectation of privacy" and "core activities of private life" that Section 11 is designed to protect.

#### B. The Ordinance is a Narrowly Tailored Solution to a Critical Safety Threat

Ordinance 42.1 does not regulate the possession of firearms within the home, nor does it prohibit their use for immediate self-defense. It regulates one specific *manner* of use—recreational discharge—in a specific *place* where its externalities pose a lethal threat.

The requirements of a certified backstop and a safety radius are not arbitrary; they are the minimum standards identified by ballistic experts to contain projectiles and prevent tragic, stray-shot deaths. This regulation is targeted precisely at the aspect of the activity that violates the rights of others: the escape of lethal force beyond the boundaries of the respondent's property.

The respondent has reasonable alternatives to achieve his goal of marksmanship practice, including transporting his firearm to one of several certified shooting ranges located within a thirty-minute drive. His neighbors have no alternative to secure their safety within their own homes against stray bullets.

#### C. Domestic Privacy Does Not Encompass Inherently Extroverted Dangerous Activities

The respondent's invocation of Article I, Section 11 is compelling but ultimately unavailing. The "core activities of private life" protected by domestic privacy—family life, intimate association, personal repose—are inherently *internal* to the property and its residents. The discharge of a firearm is an inherently *extroverted* activity; its primary risk is the lethal penetration of other private domains. A right to domestic privacy cannot be wielded as a shield to violate the identical right of one's neighbors.

### III. CONCLUSION

The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed. The Municipality of Oakwood Heights acted within its constitutional authority by enacting Ordinance 42.1.

The Constitution establishes a framework for a society of ordered liberty. The right to domestic privacy ends at the point where it is used to justify an activity that turns the homes of others into potential impact zones. The ordinance represents a permissible, narrowly tailored balance that protects the community from a demonstrated lethal hazard while preserving the core of the respondent's rights to arm himself and enjoy his property.

**IT IS SO ORDERED.**

## CONCURRING OPINION

**JUSTICE VANCE**, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize that this case is not about the right to *keep* arms, but about the right to *discharge* them in a specific context. The Respondent's domestic privacy argument cuts both ways. The framer of Section 11 spoke of protecting "the core activities of private life." What core activity is more fundamental than the secure and peaceful enjoyment of one's home without fear of lethal intrusion? The sound of a gunshot is not merely a noise; it is an acoustic signature of potential violence that fundamentally transforms the character of a neighborhood from a sanctuary into a place of danger. The municipality has not violated the Respondent's privacy; it has acted to protect the privacy of the community against the dangerous externalities of his chosen activity.

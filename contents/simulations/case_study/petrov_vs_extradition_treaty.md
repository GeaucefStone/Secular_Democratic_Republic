## SUPREME COURT RULING

### Majority Opinion
**Chief Justice [Name] delivering the opinion:**

"This Court faces the collision of two fundamental principles: our treaty obligations and our constitutional duty to protect human dignity. When these principles conflict, our Constitution must prevail.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Existential Threat Doctrine Established**
   - State-sanctioned persecution based on immutable characteristics constitutes continuous threat
   - Resistance to such persecution qualifies as self-preservation
   - The 'reasonable person' standard must account for systemic annihilation threats

2. **Bodily Autonomy is Absolute**
   - Article I, Section 6 protects the fundamental right to self-ownership
   - Defense of one's identity and existence constitutes ultimate self-defense
   - No state interest outweighs protection from identity-based annihilation

3. **Treaty Limitations**
   - Extradition treaties cannot override constitutional protections
   - Homicide exceptions do not apply to acts of existential self-defense
   - The Doctrine of Substance Over Form reveals the persecution basis of this request

### The Ruling

**IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:**

1. **Extradition Request DENIED** - Permanently barred
2. **All Charges DISMISSED** - With prejudice
3. **Asylum GRANTED** - Immediate and permanent protection
4. **Citizenship Pathway OPENED** - Fast-track eligibility approved

**The Petrov Doctrine is established:** Acts committed during escape from state-sanctioned persecution based on protected characteristics may qualify as justified existential self-defense.

## SYLLABUS

A privacy fence constructed to protect lawful private activities within the curtilage of one's home constitutes a constitutionally protected privacy-enhancing structure under Article I, Section 11. Surveillance conducted by community association members over such a fence violates multiple constitutional privacy provisions, and moral disapproval of lawful private conduct provides no legal basis for regulatory action.

## OPINION OF THE COURT

**CHIEF JUSTICE STONE** delivered the opinion of the Court.

This case requires us to determine the boundaries of domestic privacy rights when confronted with community aesthetic regulations and neighborly surveillance. We hold that the constitutional right to domestic privacy protects both the structures necessary to secure that privacy and the private activities conducted within secured spaces.

### I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

Petitioner Jane Doe legally retained her property following the transition to the Secular Democratic Republic. Seeking to engage in lawful but non-traditional private activities in her backyard, she constructed a privacy fence exceeding local height limitations.

Respondent Community Association, upon discovering petitioner's activities, conducted surveillance by peering over the fence and capturing photographic evidence. The Association then filed a complaint with respondent Housing Authority, which initiated enforcement action against petitioner for the fence height violation.

Petitioner moved to dismiss, arguing the fence was protected under Article I, Section 11 and that the surveillance constituted multiple constitutional violations. The Superior Court granted partial relief but maintained the fence height violation. This direct appeal followed.

### II. ANALYSIS

#### A. The Privacy Fence is a Constitutionally Protected Structure

Respondents contend that local height regulations trump petitioner's privacy concerns. This argument ignores the constitutional hierarchy that places fundamental rights above municipal aesthetics.

Article I, Section 11, Clause 3 explicitly protects the right to build "privacy-enhancing structures" when an individual cannot be intimate in their own backyard. The fence's height is not an aesthetic choice but a functional necessity to secure the privacy guaranteed by our Constitution. Local ordinances may regulate for safety under Clause 4, but they cannot nullify the constitutional right itself.

#### B. The Surveillance Constituted Multiple Constitutional Violations

The Community Association's surveillance represents precisely the type of intrusion our privacy provisions were designed to prevent.

**First**, peering over the fence violated Article I, Section 11's guarantee of domestic privacy within the curtilage of the home. The backyard, when secured from public view, maintains a reasonable expectation of privacy.

**Second**, capturing images without consent violated Article I, Section 8's digital privacy protections. Petitioner's likeness and private activities constitute personal data protected from non-consensual capture.

**Third**, while the images were not altered, their capture for purposes of harassment and exposure aligns with the spirit of Article I, Section 9's protections against synthetic media and non-consensual imagery.

#### C. The Nature of Petitioner's Activities is Constitutionally Irrelevant

Respondents' apparent disapproval of petitioner's lawful private activities provides no legal basis for their actions. Multiple constitutional provisions protect her choices:

*   **Article I, Section 3** protects her freedom of expression and personal belief
*   **Article I, Section 6** guarantees her bodily autonomy on her own property  
*   **Article I, Section 13** extends protection to private, consensual adult conduct

The Constitution does not recognize morality-based exceptions to fundamental rights. Private lawful conduct remains private and lawful regardless of community sentiment.

### III. CONCLUSION

The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. The enforcement action against petitioner is dismissed with prejudice.

The attempt to regulate privacy structures while simultaneously violating privacy rights represents a fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional order. The right to be let alone in one's home is not subject to popularity contests or aesthetic committees.

**IT IS SO ORDERED.**

## CONCURRING OPINION

**JUSTICE ELIOTT**, concurring.

I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to emphasize the interconnected nature of the privacy rights at stake today.

Article I, Section 11 provides the foundation—the right to secure one's domestic space. Article I, Section 6 provides the content—the autonomy to make personal choices within that space. Articles I, Sections 8 and 9 provide the perimeter defense—protecting against technological intrusion and exploitation.

This case demonstrates that privacy is not a single right but an ecosystem of protections. Violate one, and you threaten all. The respondents did not merely challenge a fence height regulation; they assaulted the entire privacy framework our Constitution establishes.

# Editor's Note

This folder contains AI-generated constitutional scenarios and analyses.

## About the Content
All materials in this directory were created using AI language models (including DeepSeek) to simulate legal scenarios and constitutional applications. In the absence of real-world test cases for this theoretical constitution, AI provides the only practical method for stress-testing its provisions and demonstrating their practical implementation.

## Media Contributions Welcome
We actively encourage community contributions, particularly video dramatizations of these scenarios. Acceptable formats include:
- Video bundles illustrating constitutional principles
- Educational dramatizations
- Even full series exploring the constitutional framework

## Content Guidelines
**Important Compliance Note:** While Codeberg doesn't explicitly prohibit profanity, all contributed media must:
- Bleep or blur any profanity
- Maintain educational/analytical context
- Avoid content that could be flagged under platform terms of service

These measures ensure the project remains compliant and accessible across platforms.

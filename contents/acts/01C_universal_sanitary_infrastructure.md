**WHEREAS** traditional segregated restroom facilities create unnecessary maintenance complexity, safety concerns, social conflict, and inefficient use of public space and resources;

**WHEREAS** water is a precious public resource, and infrastructure should encourage its conservation;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

## **Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the **"Universal Restroom Act."**

## **Section 2: Definitions**

 - **"Universal Restroom"** means a fully enclosed, private, lockable single-occupancy facility containing at minimum: one toilet, one sink with potable water, and one waterless or low-flow urinal.

 - **"Covered Facility"** means any new or substantially renovated public building, educational institution, government office, transportation hub, or place of public accommodation receiving any public funding or operating under a public license.

 - **"Substantial Renovation"** means any renovation affecting more than 50% of a facility's existing restroom square footage or costing more than 25% of the building's assessed value.

## **Section 3: Universal Restroom Mandate for New & Renovated Construction**

1. All **Covered Facilities** constructed after the effective date of this Act shall provide sanitation facilities **exclusively** in the form of **Universal Restrooms**, arranged in rows or clusters as space permits.

2. All **Covered Facilities** undergoing **Substantial Renovation** shall convert existing segregated restrooms to comply with the Universal Restroom standard.

3. **Minimum Quantity:** The number of Universal Restrooms shall meet or exceed the total fixture count (toilets + urinals) required by the previous plumbing code for the building's capacity.

## **Section 4: Design Standards & Water Conservation**

1. Each Universal Restroom shall be equipped with:

 - One high-efficiency or dual-flush toilet.

 - One waterless urinal or ultra-low-flow urinal.

 - One accessible sink with touchless faucet.

 - A lockable, full-height door.

 - Standardized, clear exterior signage depicting the fixtures contained within (e.g., a toilet, a urinal, a sink) with the text **"Restroom"**.

2. The inclusion of the urinal is for the **express purpose of water conservation**, recognizing its significantly lower water use per use compared to a toilet flush, and is available for use by any person for whom it is a practical fixture.

3. A minimum of twenty percent (20%) of Universal Restrooms in any cluster shall be designed to full accessibility standards.

## **Section 5: Phased Implementation for Existing Facilities**

Existing Covered Facilities not undergoing renovation shall develop a **Compliance Plan** within three (3) years to gradually convert a minimum of one traditional restroom to a Universal Restroom cluster per floor or wing, with full compliance targeted within fifteen (15) years.

## **Section 6: Preemption & Anti-Discrimination Clause**

1. This Act **preempts** any local ordinance, HOA rule, or private policy that mandates gender-segregated restrooms in Covered Facilities.

2. No person may be denied access to, harassed within, or questioned regarding their use of a Universal Restroom. Violations constitute a violation of **Article I, Section 1** and are subject to civil penalties.

## **Section 7: Funding & Incentives**

The Department of Public Works shall administer a grant program, funded from the Public Utilities budget (Art. III, Sec. 6), to cover 60% of conversion costs for small businesses and non-profit Covered Facilities.

## **Section 8: Oversight**

The Office of Neutral Conduit Oversight (ONCO) from the **Financial & Digital Neutrality Act** shall be expanded to include a **Sanitary Infrastructure Division** to handle complaints and ensure compliance.

## **Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Section 1 (Universal Equal Protection):** This Act proactively eliminates a major arena of potential discrimination, ensuring equal access to essential facilities.

 - **Article I, Section 11 (Right to Domestic Privacy):** By providing fully enclosed, lockable single-occupancy rooms, it maximizes personal privacy in public accommodations.

 - **Article III, Section 6 (Public Utilities):** The water conservation mandate and funding mechanism align with the state's duty to manage precious resources sustainably.

 - **Article VII (Constitutional Supremacy):** The preemption clause ensures uniform, rights-compliant standards nationwide, preventing local discriminatory ordinances.

**Methodology:** This Act follows the SDR legislative pipeline: it identifies a social conflict rooted in outdated design, proposes a material solution that enhances privacy and efficiency, and embeds enforcement within existing anti-discrimination and public works frameworks.

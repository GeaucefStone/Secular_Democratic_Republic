- **“Substance”** means any psychoactive or intoxicating substance, including alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, prescribed psychoactive medications, and illicit drugs.
- **“Substance-Free Zone”** means a designated area or entire establishment where the use of one or more substances is prohibited.
- **“Reasonable Accommodation”** means the provision of a separate, comparable space or service within the same establishment that accommodates individuals who do not use the permitted substance(s).
- **“Operator”** means the owner, manager, or governing body of an establishment.
- **“Firearm-Sensitive Establishment”** means any venue where firearms are present, stored, sold, serviced, or used, including but not limited to: gun stores, shooting ranges, hunting lodges, firearm training facilities, and security firms.
- **“Child-Focused Establishment”** means any venue primarily designed for or frequented by minors under the age of 18, including but not limited to: schools, daycare centers, playgrounds, pediatric clinics, children’s museums, and family recreation centers.

## **Section 3: Right to Designate Substance-Free Zones**

1. Any operator may designate part or all of their establishment as a **Substance-Free Zone** for one or more substances, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, or other drugs.
2. Such designation must be:
   - Clearly posted at all entrances and within the zone
   - Applied consistently and without discrimination based on protected characteristics under Article I, Section 1
   - Based on legitimate concerns such as health, safety, cultural or religious practice, family-friendliness, or operational necessity

## **Section 4: The Accommodation or Prohibition Mandate**

1. **Option A – Prohibition:**
   - An operator may **prohibit the use of specific substances** entirely within their establishment.
   - Such prohibition must be clearly stated in posted policies and enforced uniformly.

2. **Option B – Accommodation:**
   - If an operator permits a substance in certain areas, they must provide a **Reasonable Accommodation** for non-users.
   - Examples include:
     - Non-smoking sections in restaurants
     - Alcohol-free seating at events
     - Drug-free floors in residential buildings
     - Separate ventilation or outdoor areas for substance use

3. **Minimum Standard for Accommodation:**
   - Accommodated spaces must be **comparable in quality, access, and comfort** to spaces where substance use is permitted.
   - They must comprise no less than **30% of the total capacity or area** of the establishment, unless a smaller percentage is justified by demonstrable low demand.

## **Section 5: Mandatory Prohibition in High-Risk Environments**

1. **Firearm-Sensitive Establishments:**
   - The use or possession of any substance, except medically necessary prescriptions taken as directed, is **strictly prohibited** in all Firearm-Sensitive Establishments.
   - This prohibition applies to all patrons, employees, and visitors while on the premises.
   - Operators must post clear signage stating: “Substance use prohibited. Firearms present.”

2. **Child-Focused Establishments:**
   - The use of any non-medical substance is **strictly prohibited** in all Child-Focused Establishments.
   - This includes outdoor areas, parking lots, and adjacent properties under the operator’s control.
   - Medically necessary prescriptions are permitted only if securely stored and administered in a manner that prevents exposure to children.

3. **Medical Exception:**
   - Substances prescribed by a licensed medical professional and used in accordance with that prescription are exempt from the prohibitions in this section, provided:
     - The user is not impaired in a manner that poses a safety risk.
     - The substance is stored securely and out of reach of children in Child-Focused Establishments.
     - In Firearm-Sensitive Establishments, the user must provide proof of prescription upon request and may be subject to a sobriety assessment if impairment is suspected.

## **Section 6: Exemptions & Limitations**

1. **Medical Use:** This Act does not restrict the use of medically prescribed substances taken in accordance with a prescription, provided such use does not impair safety or disrupt operations and complies with Section 5.
2. **Private Residences:** This Act does not apply to private homes, except when they operate as commercial establishments (e.g., bed-and-breakfasts) or host firearm-related activities open to the public.
3. **Age-Restricted Venues:** Establishments that legally restrict entry to adults may implement substance policies without accommodation, provided such policies are clearly stated prior to entry.
4. **Emergency Services & Healthcare Facilities:** These may implement stricter substance policies without accommodation requirements when justified by safety or medical necessity.

## **Section 7: Enforcement & Posting Requirements**

1. Operators must post signage that includes:
   - The substances prohibited or restricted
   - The location of accommodated spaces (if applicable)
   - Consequences for violation (e.g., removal, fines)
2. In Firearm-Sensitive and Child-Focused Establishments, signage must explicitly state the mandatory prohibition and the medical exception.
3. Enforcement must be conducted in a non-discriminatory manner.
4. Patrons who violate posted policies may be asked to leave and may be subject to trespassing penalties if they refuse.

4. **Enhanced Penalties for High-Risk Environments:**
   - Violations in Firearm-Sensitive or Child-Focused Establishments shall result in immediate fines of no less than 5% of annual revenue and mandatory closure until compliance is verified.

## **Section 9: Protection from Retaliation**

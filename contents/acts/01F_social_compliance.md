## **Preamble**

**WHEREAS** the Republic recognizes that corporations and large-scale entities operating within its jurisdiction derive benefit from public infrastructure, educated workforce, legal stability, and collective security;

**WHEREAS** such entities incur a reciprocal obligation to uphold the fundamental rights and social contracts enshrined in the Constitution, including non-discrimination, privacy, accessibility, and environmental stewardship;

**WHEREAS** voluntary compliance with progressive social standards has proven insufficient to ensure universal dignity, safety, and equity in public accommodations;

**WHEREAS** the power of the purse and the authority of taxation are among the most direct and constitutionally sound mechanisms to align corporate behavior with constitutional values;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

## **Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the **“Fiscal Leverage for Social Equity Act.”**

- **“Compliance Certification”** means official verification issued by the relevant regulatory body that a Regulated Entity meets all applicable Social Equity Standards.

- **“Non-Compliance Event”** means a formal finding by a regulatory body that a Regulated Entity has failed to meet a Social Equity Standard.

## **Section 3: Graduated Fiscal Compliance Framework**

### **Tier 1: Federal Fund Conditioning**

1. No Regulated Entity shall be eligible to receive, directly or indirectly:

   - Any new federal contract, grant, subsidy, or loan guarantee.

   - Any renewal or extension of existing federal financial agreements.

   _Unless_ it holds a valid Compliance Certification.

### **Tier 2: Tax Benefit Suspension**

1. Any Regulated Entity that fails to achieve Compliance Certification within two (2) years of an SES taking effect shall become ineligible to receive:

   - Any tax refund, rebate, or credit from federal or state authorities.

   - Any accelerated depreciation or special deduction related to facility improvement or environmental compliance.

2. All such suspended benefits shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account managed by the Treasury Department.

### **Tier 3: Escrow Conversion & Surcharge**

1. If a Regulated Entity remains non-compliant for three (3) consecutive years:

 - All escrowed funds from Tier 2 shall be permanently forfeited to the Public Housing Trust.

 - A **Progressive Surcharge** shall be applied to the entity's annual corporate tax liability, according to the following schedule:
  * Year 4: 25% surcharge
  * Year 5: 50% surcharge
  * Year 6: 100% surcharge
  * Year 7+: 150% surcharge, compounded annually

### **Tier 4: Retaliatory Non-Compliance Penalty**

1. If a Regulated Entity engages in **Retaliatory Non-Compliance**—defined as willful reduction of tax payments, asset concealment, or operational restructuring to avoid SES obligations—the following shall apply:

 - Immediate forfeiture of all escrowed funds.

 - Application of a 300% surcharge on all taxes owed during the period of retaliation.

 - Pursuant to **Article II, Section 12**, corporate veil may be pierced to impose joint personal liability on directors and controlling officers for the surcharge amount.

 - Mandatory referral to the Department of Public Integrity for criminal investigation.

## **Section 4: Transparency & Public Accountability**

1. The Treasury Department shall maintain and publish a **Public Compliance Ledger** listing all Regulated Entities, their compliance status, federal funds received, and tax benefits suspended or forfeited.

2. Any citizen may file a verified report of non-compliance, triggering a mandatory audit by the relevant regulatory body within 60 days.

3. Regulatory bodies shall conduct annual random audits of no less than 15% of Regulated Entities to ensure ongoing compliance.

## **Section 5: Small Business Exemption & Support**

1. Entities with fewer than 50 employees and under $5 million in annual revenue shall be exempt from Tiers 2–4 for a period of five (5) years following SES enactment.

2. A **Small Business Compliance Fund** shall be established to provide grants covering up to 75% of compliance costs for exempt entities that voluntarily meet SES ahead of schedule.

3. The Fund shall be financed by 20% of all surcharges and forfeitures collected under Section 3.

## **Section 6: Phased Implementation & Rulemaking**

1. This Act shall take effect 180 days after passage.

2. The Treasury Department, in consultation with the Scientific and Worker's Branches, shall issue rules defining:

 - The precise metrics for each Social Equity Standard.

 - Certification procedures and audit standards.

 - Mechanisms for appeal and corrective action periods.

3. The first Social Equity Standards to which this Act shall apply are:

 - Universal single-occupancy restroom accessibility (per ACT-XXXX).

 - Minimum energy and water efficiency standards for commercial buildings.

 - Mandatory provision of lactation rooms in workplaces with 20+ employees.

## **Section 7: Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Sections 1, 11, 19:** This Act enforces the realization of fundamental rights through material conditions in public life.

 - **Article II, Section 12 (Substance Over Form):** Empowers the state to disregard corporate structures designed to evade social responsibility.

 - **Article III, Section 6 (Public Utilities):** Aligns corporate behavior with sustainable resource management.

 - **Article VII (Constitutional Supremacy):** Ensures uniform national standards through federal fiscal authority.

 - **Article XII (Accountability):** Establishes severe consequences for entities that would undermine constitutional values for profit.

**Methodology:** This Act operationalizes the SDR principle that rights without enforcement are merely suggestions. It creates a graduated, inescapable financial logic that makes compliance with human dignity standards the only rational choice for capital, thereby transforming the built environment and social contract through the irresistible force of economic necessity.

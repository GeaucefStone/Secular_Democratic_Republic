**Co-Sponsors:** Scientific Branch, Citizen's Assembly, Department of Public Health  
**Date of Introduction:** [Date]

## **Preamble**

**WHEREAS** the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense and other lawful purposes is protected under Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution;

**WHEREAS** with this right comes a profound responsibility to ensure the safety of innocent bystanders, neighbors, and the general public;

**WHEREAS** certain types of ammunition, particularly full metal jacket (FMJ) or "target rounds," are designed for range use and training, and pose a significantly higher risk of overpenetration in populated environments, potentially passing through walls, doors, or vehicles and striking unintended persons;

**WHEREAS** the choice of ammunition during the commission of a crime reflects a conscious disregard for human life beyond the immediate target, demonstrating an escalated threat to public safety;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

## **Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the **"Community Firearms Safety Act."**

## **Section 2: Definitions**

 - **"Target Round"** means any full metal jacket (FMJ), round-nose, or non-expanding pistol or rifle cartridge primarily designed for target shooting, training, or military simulation, which is not engineered to expand or deform significantly upon impact with soft tissue. This includes, but is not limited to, ammunition commonly designated as "ball ammunition" or "FMJ."

 - **"Defensive Round"** means any hollow-point, soft-point, or other expanding/deforming cartridge specifically engineered to maximize energy transfer within a target and minimize the risk of overpenetration.

 - **"General Carry"** means the act of possessing a loaded firearm on one's person or in a vehicle in any public space, or within any private residence that is not a designated and certified shooting range.

 - **"Designated Shooting Range"** means a facility constructed and certified for live-fire training, with appropriate ballistic containment, backstops, and safety protocols, as defined by the Department of Public Safety.

 - **"Criminal Activity"** means any act constituting a felony or violent misdemeanor under the Republic's legal code during which a firearm is possessed, brandished, or used.

## **Section 3: Prohibition on Target Rounds for General Carry**

1. **Unlawful Possession:** It shall be unlawful for any person to possess a firearm loaded with **Target Rounds** while engaged in **General Carry**.

2. **Presumption for Loaded Firearms:** Any firearm found loaded in a public space or a vehicle shall be presumed to be for the purpose of General Carry. The burden shall be on the possessor to demonstrate they were in direct transit to or from a **Designated Shooting Range**.

3. **Lawful Storage & Transport:** Target Rounds may be legally possessed, stored, and transported to and from a Designated Shooting Range, provided they are stored separately from any firearm in a locked container during transport.

## **Section 4: Enhanced Penalties for Use of Target Rounds During Criminal Activity**

1. **Aggravating Factor:** The possession, brandishment, or use of a firearm loaded with **Target Rounds** during the commission of a **Criminal Activity** shall constitute an **Aggravating Factor** for sentencing purposes.

2. **Charge Enhancement:** Any underlying criminal charge (e.g., assault, robbery, homicide) shall be enhanced by one degree (e.g., a second-degree felony becomes a first-degree felony) if a firearm loaded with Target Rounds is involved.

3. **Separate Charge:** In addition to enhancement, the offender shall be charged with **"Reckless Endangerment of the Public,"** a felony carrying a mandatory minimum sentence of **3 years**, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the underlying crime.

4. **Rationale:** The use of ammunition with high overpenetration risk in a populated area demonstrates **extreme indifference to human life** and substantially increases the probable harm to bystanders.

## **Section 5: Public Education & Safe Ammunition Standards**

1. **Public Awareness Campaign:** The Department of Public Safety, in consultation with the Scientific Branch, shall launch a public education campaign on:
 - The ballistic differences between Target Rounds and Defensive Rounds.
 - The risks of overpenetration in home and urban defense scenarios.
 - The legal requirements of this Act.

2. **Point-of-Sale Notification:** All vendors of ammunition must display clear signage and provide written notice at the point of sale regarding the legal restrictions on Target Rounds for General Carry.

3. **Recommended Standards:** The Scientific Branch shall publish and periodically update a **Balanced Ammunition Standard** recommending designs that effectively balance stopping power, reduced overpenetration, and reliability for lawful defensive use.

## **Section 6: Exemptions**

1. **Law Enforcement & Military:** On-duty military personnel and law enforcement officers acting within official capacity are exempt from Section 3 when department policy or operational necessity requires the use of such ammunition.

2. **Historical & Collector Firearms:** Bona fide collectors of historical firearms (pre-20th century) may possess period-appropriate ammunition, provided the firearm is not used for General Carry.

3. **Rural Designations:** The Department of Public Safety may designate certain low-population-density rural zones where overpenetration risk is demonstrably negligible, subject to annual review.

## **Section 7: Enforcement & Penalties**

1. **Violation of Section 3 (Possession for General Carry):**

 - First Offense: Civil infraction, fine up to $500, and mandatory completion of a firearm safety course.

 - Second Offense: Misdemeanor, up to 1 year in jail, and suspension of firearms license for 2 years.

2. **Violation of Section 4 (Use in Crime):** Governed by the enhanced sentencing and consecutive penalties outlined in that section.

## **Section 8: Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Section 10 (Right to Bear Arms):** This Act regulates the *manner* of exercising the right (ammunition type in public spaces) to fulfill the corresponding responsibility to public safety. It does not infringe on the core right to own firearms or to use any lawful ammunition at a range.

 - **Article I, Section 9 (Right to Life & Physical Well-Being):** Protects bystanders and neighbors from the heightened, indiscriminate danger posed by overpenetrating ammunition in populated areas.

 - **Article II, Section 9 (Doctrine of Substance Over Form):** Recognizes that the choice of ammunition during a crime is not neutral; it reflects a more dangerous criminal intent.

 - **Scientific Branch Mandate (Article IV, Sec. 8):** The law is grounded in the ballistic science of terminal performance and overpenetration risk.

**Methodology:** This Act follows the SDR principle of using precise, evidence-based regulation to mitigate a specific public safety risk (bystander injury from overpenetration) without broadly restricting lawful rights. It creates a clear legal distinction between responsible preparation for self-defense and reckless conduct that endangers the community.

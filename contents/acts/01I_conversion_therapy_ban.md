## **Preamble**

**WHEREAS** sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are inherent aspects of human identity protected under Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution;

**WHEREAS** the global scientific consensus, as affirmed by the World Health Organization, the American Psychological Association, and the Republic's own Scientific Branch, holds that attempts to change or suppress a person's sexual orientation or gender identity are not only ineffective but cause severe psychological harm, including depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide;

**WHEREAS** such practices constitute a profound violation of bodily autonomy (Article I, Section 6) and the right to freedom of thought and belief (Article I, Section 3);

**WHEREAS** children, youth identifying as LGBTQ+, and those perceived to be LGBTQ+ are uniquely vulnerable to family-based coercion, confinement, and so-called "therapeutic" abuse;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

## **Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the **"Therapeutic Integrity & Anti-Conversion Act."**

## **Section 2: Definitions**

 - **"Conversion Practice"** means any treatment, intervention, counseling, regimen, or activity that seeks to change, suppress, or eradicate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, or which seeks to enforce compliance with gender stereotypes. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Talk therapy or counseling with such a goal.
  * Behavioral interventions, including aversion therapy.
  * Spiritual or religious counseling, prayer groups, exorcism, or deliverance practices.
  * Residential programs, retreats, or camps designed for this purpose.
  * The prescription of medication or use of medical procedures for this purpose.

 - **"Protected Characteristic"** for the purposes of this Act means a person's actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

 - **"LGBTQ+ Youth"** means any person under the age of 18 who identifies as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or any other non-heterosexual or non-cisgender identity, **or who is perceived as such by a perpetrator of a Conversion Practice.**

 - **"Licensed Professional"** means any person legally authorized to provide healthcare, mental health services, counseling, or religious guidance within the Republic, including but not limited to: physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, counselors, religious leaders, and traditional healers.

 - **"Deceptive Confinement for Conversion"** means the intentional and unlawful restriction of a person's freedom of movement through force, threat, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting them to a Conversion Practice. This includes:
  * Transporting a minor to a conversion facility without their consent and against the will of any custodial parent or guardian who objects.
  * Luring a person to a location under false pretenses to subject them to conversion practices.
  * Using the legal guardianship of a minor or vulnerable adult to place them in a residential conversion program.

## **Section 3: Absolute Prohibition & Presumption of Coercion**

1. **Criminal Offense:** It is unlawful for any person, organization, or entity to:

 - Advertise, offer, or perform a Conversion Practice on any person within the Republic.

 - Receive remuneration for such a practice.

 - Transport or arrange for any person to travel within or outside the Republic for the purpose of undergoing a Conversion Practice.

2. **Presumption of Coercion for LGBTQ+ Youth:** Any Conversion Practice performed on an **LGBTQ+ Youth** is **irrebuttably presumed** to be coercive and non-consensual, regardless of parental consent or the youth’s stated compliance under duress.

3. **No Defenses:** It shall be no defense to a charge under this Act that:

 - The person subjected to the practice or their guardian consented.

 - The practice was conducted in accordance with religious or traditional beliefs.

 - The practitioner believed the practice was in the subject's best interest.

## **Section 4: Mandatory Minimum Sentencing & Deterrent Schedule**

### **Base Offense (Tier 1): Performing a Conversion Practice**

 - **Mandatory Minimum:** **5 years** imprisonment.

 - **Mandatory Fine:** **$100,000**.

### **Aggravating Multipliers (Applied Sequentially to the Base Minimum)**

#### **Multiplier A: Victim Status (×2)**

 - **Trigger:** Victim is an **LGBTQ+ Youth** (actual or perceived).

 - **New Minimum:** **10 years**. Fine: **$200,000**.

#### **Multiplier B: Familial Betrayal (×1.5)**

 - **Trigger:** Perpetrator is a parent, legal guardian, or primary caregiver.

 - **Applied to current minimum:** 10 years × 1.5 = **15 years**.

#### **Multiplier C: Deceptive Confinement/Kidnapping (+20 years consecutive)**

 - **Trigger:** Involves unlawful restraint, transport to a facility, or removal from the home for conversion purposes.

 - **Not a multiplier—a stacked sentence:** Base sentence (after other multipliers) **+ 20 years**, served consecutively.

 - **New Minimum:** 15 years + 20 years = **35 years**.

#### **Multiplier D: Resultant Harm (×2)**

 - **Trigger:** Practice leads to diagnosed psychological trauma, suicide attempt, or severe self-harm.

 - **Applied to the Base Minimum before Kidnapping addition:** (10 years × 1.5 × 2) = **30 years**.

 - **Then add Kidnapping:** 30 years + 20 years = **50 years**.

#### **Multiplier E: Commercial/Institutional Scale (×3 & Asset Forfeiture)**

 - **Trigger:** Advertising, operating a facility, or systematically profiting.

 - **Applied to Base Minimum:** 5 years × 3 = **15 years** as a new starting point for other multipliers.

 - **Plus:** Full forfeiture of all assets related to the operation.

#### **Multiplier F: Culpable Homicide (Life Without Parole)**

 - **Trigger:** Conversion Practice is a substantial cause of the victim's death.

 - **Sentence:** Mandatory **Life Imprisonment Without Parole**.

## **Section 5: The "Deterrent Schedule" – Public Notice Requirement**

1. The Department of Justice shall publish and widely disseminate a **"Deterrent Schedule"** as a public notice, clearly outlining the mandatory minimums and multipliers defined in Section 4.

2. This schedule shall use plain language and illustrative examples (e.g., "If you send your child to a conversion camp, you are looking at a minimum of 35 years in prison").

3. Ignorance of this schedule shall not be a defense, as its publication fulfills the state's duty to inform.

## **Section 6: Professional Consequences**

1. Any **Licensed Professional** convicted under this Act shall be permanently stripped of their professional license and barred from any future licensure in a helping profession.

2. Any religious institution found to have knowingly hosted, promoted, or funded conversion practices shall lose its tax-exempt status and be subject to the financial penalties outlined in **Article I, Section 2, Clause 5**.

## **Section 7: Civil Cause of Action & Victim Restitution**

1. **Unlimited Liability:** Any person subjected to a Conversion Practice may bring a civil suit against the perpetrators and any enabling institutions for damages, including compensation for pain and suffering, psychological harm, medical expenses, and punitive damages. There shall be no statutory cap on damages.

2. **Victim Restitution Fund:** A fund shall be established, financed by all fines and forfeitures collected under this Act, to provide victims with free access to affirmative therapy, medical care, housing, and financial support.

## **Section 8: Safe Harbor for Youth & Mandatory Reporting**

1. **Safe Harbor:** Any LGBTQ+ Youth subjected to a Conversion Practice is automatically eligible for immediate emancipation support under **Article I, Section 15** and safe housing through the Public Housing Trust.

2. **Duty to Report:** All Licensed Professionals, educators, and public servants who have reasonable grounds to believe a Conversion Practice is occurring or being planned must report it to the Department of Justice. Failure to report is a misdemeanor.

3. **Public Education:** The Department of Public Health, in consultation with the Scientific Branch and LGBTQ+ Rights Commission, shall implement a nationwide public education campaign on the dangers of conversion practices and the validity of LGBTQ+ identities.

## **Section 9: Extraterritorial Jurisdiction**

1. This Act applies to:

 - All acts committed within the Republic.

 - Acts committed outside the Republic by a citizen or permanent resident of the Republic.

 - Acts committed outside the Republic against a citizen or permanent resident of the Republic.

2. **Travel Ban:** Any organization or individual known to practice or promote conversion therapy abroad shall be placed on a travel ban and inadmissible list.

## **Section 10: Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Section 1 (Universal Equal Protection):** Prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Conversion practices are the therapeutic arm of such discrimination.

 - **Article I, Section 6 (Bodily Autonomy):** Protects individuals from coercive and harmful practices imposed upon their body and mind.

 - **Article I, Section 3 (Freedom of Belief):** Does not protect practices that inflict severe harm on others under the guise of belief.

 - **Article II, Section 11 (Criminal Conspiracy & Kidnapping):** Provides the basis for charging kidnapping and conspiracy in furtherance of conversion practices.

 - **Article II, Section 13 (Psychological Assault):** Classification of conversion practices as a violent felony due to their severe and lasting psychological impact.

 - **Article IV, Section 8 (Scientific Branch):** Grounds the prohibition in settled scientific consensus on the harm and inefficacy of such practices.

 - **Article I, Section 15 (Right to Safe Emancipation for Minors):** Provides the legal pathway to safety for youth targeted by these practices.

**Methodology:** This Act employs a strategy of **transparent, escalatory, and mandatory penal arithmetic**. By publishing clear mandatory minimums and multiplicative enhancements tied to specific aggravating factors, it communicates to potential offenders—especially parents and caregivers—the severe and inescapable consequences of their actions *before* they act. This is designed to deter the crime at its point of conception by making the cost calculable and unacceptably high.

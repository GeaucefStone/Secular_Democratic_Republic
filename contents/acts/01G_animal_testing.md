## **Preamble**

**WHEREAS** the Republic recognizes the inherent dignity and capacity for suffering of all sentient beings, and affirms that cruelty toward animals is incompatible with a just and compassionate society;

**WHEREAS** the scientific method must evolve to reflect both ethical rigor and empirical validity, acknowledging that non-human animal models frequently fail to accurately predict human biological responses, leading to misleading data, wasted resources, and delayed medical progress;

**WHEREAS** superior, human-relevant research methodologies—including advanced in vitro systems, organ-on-a-chip technology, sophisticated computational modeling, and ethically governed human volunteer studies—now offer more reliable, efficient, and morally sound pathways to biomedical discovery;

**WHEREAS** the Republic has a duty to foster scientific innovation that aligns with its constitutional values of bodily autonomy, non-violence, and the responsible stewardship of life;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

## **Section 1: Short Title**

This Act may be cited as the **"Ethical Research Advancement Act."**

## **Section 2: Definitions**

 - **"Animal"** means any non-human vertebrate, cephalopod, or decapod crustacean capable of experiencing pain, distress, or lasting harm.

 - **"Animal Testing"** means any experimental or other scientific use of an animal that may cause pain, suffering, distress, or lasting harm, including but not limited to:
  * Procedures performed for research, education, training, or product development.
  * The breeding of genetically modified animals intended to suffer from disease, deformity, or disability.
  * The use of animals in the production of antibodies, serum, or other biological materials where non-animal alternatives exist.

 - **"Validated Alternative Method"** means any scientific method that:
  * Does not involve the use of live animals.
  * Has been scientifically verified to provide data of equivalent or superior relevance and reliability for the intended purpose.
  * Is accepted for use by relevant international scientific or regulatory bodies.

 - **"Research Institution"** means any entity, public or private, that conducts or funds biomedical, toxicological, or basic biological research within the Republic.

## **Section 3: Prohibition on Animal Testing**

1. **General Ban:** It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation, or Research Institution within the jurisdiction of the Republic to conduct, commission, or fund Animal Testing for any purpose, including but not limited to:

 - Basic biological research.

 - Drug discovery and development.

 - Toxicity and safety testing for chemicals, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, or consumer products.

 - Educational or training exercises.

2. **Immediate Cessation:** All ongoing Animal Testing must cease within **one (1) year** of this Act's effective date. All existing permits, approvals, or protocols authorizing Animal Testing are hereby revoked as of that date.

3. **Import and Sale Ban:** The importation, sale, or offer for sale within the Republic of any product whose development or safety assessment relied on Animal Testing conducted after this Act's effective date is prohibited. A transition period of **three (3) years** is granted for existing inventory and supply chains to adapt.

## **Section 4: Mandatory Adoption of Alternative Methods**

1. **Duty to Transition:** All Research Institutions must develop and submit an **Alternative Method Transition Plan** to the Scientific Branch within **six (6 months)** of this Act's effective date.

2. **Funding for Innovation:** A **Center for Advanced Human-Relevant Science** shall be established under the Scientific Branch. Its mandate is to:

 - Fund the development, validation, and standardization of non-animal methodologies.

 - Provide grants, training, and technical resources to Research Institutions transitioning away from animal models.

 - Establish public biorepositories of human-derived cells and tissues for research use.

3. **Preference in Public Funding:** All public grants for biomedical research shall give priority to proposals employing validated or innovative non-animal methodologies.

## **Section 5: Oversight and Enforcement**

1. **The Office of Ethical Research Compliance (OERC)** is hereby established within the Scientific Branch to:

 - Review and approve Alternative Method Transition Plans.

 - Conduct unannounced audits of laboratories and research facilities.

 - Investigate reports of non-compliance.

2. **Penalties for Violation:**

 - Any Research Institution found in violation of Section 3 shall be subject to a fine of no less than **$1,000,000** per violation and permanent ineligibility for all public research funding.

 - Individuals directly responsible for conducting illegal Animal Testing shall be subject to professional decertification, fines, and potential imprisonment of up to **five (5) years** for egregious or repeat offenses.

 - Evidence obtained from illegal Animal Testing shall be inadmissible in any regulatory approval process within the Republic.

## **Section 6: International Cooperation & Standards Leadership**

1. The Republic shall actively advocate within international bodies for the global adoption of non-animal testing standards.

2. The Republic will not recognize or accept regulatory data from foreign jurisdictions that is solely derived from Animal Testing conducted after this Act's effective date for the purpose of approving products for use within the Republic.

3. The Scientific Branch is authorized to establish bilateral and multilateral agreements to share alternative method data and coordinate on validation studies.

## **Section 7: Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Section 6 (Bodily Autonomy):** Establishes a principle of consent and non-harm that extends logically to a prohibition on the non-consensual harm of other sentient beings.

 - **Article IV, Section 8 (Scientific Branch Mandate):** Directly empowers the Scientific Branch to define and enforce standards for ethical, empirically sound research methodologies.

 - **Article VII (Constitutional Supremacy):** Ensures this ethical standard uniformly applies across all jurisdictions within the Republic, preventing local circumvention.

**Methodology:** This Act follows the SDR legislative principle of identifying an outdated, unethical, and inefficient practice (animal testing) and using state power to mandate a transition to a superior alternative. It leverages the Republic's scientific capacity and regulatory autonomy to drive ethical innovation, positioning the SDR as a global leader in humane and human-relevant science.

## **Preamble**

**WHEREAS** the Republic recognizes that military service is both a profound civic duty and a grave responsibility requiring sound judgment, emotional regulation, and mature decision-making;

**WHEREAS** developmental neuroscience has established that the human prefrontal cortex—responsible for executive function, risk assessment, impulse control, and complex moral reasoning—does not reach full maturity until approximately age 25;

**WHEREAS** the Republic has a solemn obligation to protect its youth from unnecessary exposure to high-intensity combat before they possess the neurological development necessary to process such experiences with resilience and judgment;

**WHEREAS** early entry into military service can provide valuable structure, education, and career pathways for motivated youth, provided such service is appropriately tiered and developmental in nature;

**BE IT ENACTED** by the Legislative Congress of the Secular Democratic Republic as follows:

---

 - **"Secondary Education Diploma"** means a certificate issued upon completion of a state-recognized secondary education curriculum, confirming proficiency in core academic subjects as defined by the Department of Education.

 - **"Alternative Viable Certificate (AVC)"** means a credential, by whatever name designated by local jurisdictions, that certifies an individual has achieved a standard of knowledge and skill equivalent to that of a Secondary Education Diploma, as verified by the National Qualifications Authority.

 - **"Infantry Role"** means any military occupational specialty whose primary duty involves direct, sustained engagement in ground combat, including but not limited to roles in front-line units, mechanized infantry, and direct-action combat arms.

 - **"Specialized Force"** means any unit or role requiring advanced technical skill, independent operational judgment, or high-stakes decision-making, including but not limited to: special operations forces, intelligence operatives, pilots of manned aircraft, drone operators with lethal authority, cyber warfare operatives, and members of psychological operations units.

## **Section 3: Tiered Age Requirements for Enlistment & Deployment**

### **Tier 1: Entry & Training (Ages 16–20)**
1. **Eligibility for Enlistment:**

 - Individuals may volunteer for enlistment upon reaching age **16**, provided they possess a **Secondary Education Diploma**.

 - Individuals may volunteer for enlistment upon reaching age **18**, provided they possess an **Alternative Viable Certificate**.

2. **Service Restrictions:**

 - All recruits under age 21 shall be classified as **"Developmental Service Members."**

 - Developmental Service Members may not be deployed in **Infantry Roles** or assigned to combat zones.

 - Their service shall focus on: advanced training, technical education, support roles, homeland defense duties, and participation in structured leadership development programs.

### **Tier 2: Combat Eligibility (Age 21+)**

1. **Infantry Deployment Authorization:**

 - Upon reaching age **21**, a service member who has completed BMQ and any required advanced infantry training may be deployed in an **Infantry Role**.

2. **Command Oversight Requirement:**

 - Service members aged 21–24 in infantry roles shall be assigned to units with a higher ratio of experienced non-commissioned officers (no less than 1:5) and shall not be placed in independent command positions.

### **Tier 3: Specialized Force Eligibility (Age 25+)**

1. **Minimum Age for Specialized Forces:**

 - No person may be assessed for, selected for, or deployed as a member of a **Specialized Force** until they have reached age **25**.

2. **Cognitive & Psychological Assessment:**

 - All candidates for Specialized Forces must pass a standardized **Cognitive Maturity & Resilience Evaluation** developed and administered by the Scientific Branch in consultation with the Defense Force Medical Corps.

## **Section 4: Developmental Service Pathways**

1. **Educational Continuation:** Developmental Service Members (ages 16–20) shall be guaranteed access to, and funding for, continued academic or vocational education relevant to military and civilian career paths.

2. **Mentorship Program:** Each Developmental Service Member shall be assigned a mentor of at least age 25 who holds a rank no lower than Sergeant (or equivalent).

3. **Progressive Responsibility:** Training and duties for Developmental Service Members shall be designed to incrementally increase in responsibility in alignment with cognitive and emotional development.

## **Section 5: Waivers & Exceptions**

1. **National Emergency:** In a formally declared state of existential threat under **Article VI**, the age restrictions for infantry deployment (Tier 2) may be suspended by a joint resolution of the President and a ⅔ majority of Congress. The restriction for Specialized Forces (Tier 3) may **never** be suspended.

2. **Individual Extraordinary Circumstance:** An individual who has reached age 20 may petition for early eligibility for infantry roles. Granting such a petition requires:

 - A favorable recommendation from their commanding officer and unit psychologist.

 - Successful completion of an enhanced psychological and cognitive assessment.

 - Approval by a review board composed of senior officers and a representative from the Scientific Branch.

## **Section 6: Oversight & Reporting**

1. The **Office of Service Member Development (OSMD)** is hereby established within the Department of Defense to monitor compliance with this Act and oversee the welfare of Developmental Service Members.

2. The Scientific Branch shall conduct a biennial review of the neurological and psychological outcomes for service members under age 25, with findings reported publicly to the Citizen's Assembly.

## **Section 7: Constitutional Compliance Justification**

 - **Article I, Section 6 (Bodily Autonomy & Medical Privacy):** Supports the use of developmental science to protect young individuals from premature exposure to severe trauma.

 - **Article IV, Section 8 (Scientific Branch Mandate):** Authorizes the use of neuroscientific evidence to inform policy on cognitive readiness.

 - **Article XIV, Section 2 (Suspension of Rights During Service):** Acknowledges that military service entails modified rights, making age-graded restrictions a lawful expression of the state's duty of care.

 - **Article I, Section 15 (Right to Safe Emancipation for Minors):** Aligns with the state's role as a protective entity for youth, offering a structured, developmental path as an alternative to unstable home environments.

**Methodology:** This Act follows the SDR legislative model of applying empirical evidence (neurodevelopmental science) to a matter of profound human consequence (military service). It balances opportunity for youth with protection from premature harm, creating a developmental pipeline that produces not only effective soldiers, but resilient and mature citizens.

# Department Structure

This file is intended to serve as a guide on how to build a organized government. You may expand the list as necessary, with the next two smallest sectors being "unit" and "subunit". 

These should be organized in their own folders in Markdown, as shown in other existing files. 

All names should be self-explanatory, and they shall be controlled by professionals of each field. 

Together, they can consult with each other and create their own organizations, similar to OSHA or the EPA but with different methods. Think of this document as a set of libraries used in software, and bundled together to write a specialized program.

Most of these people working under these departments are not elected officials. They have degrees, and they have the ability to vote for a chairman within their respective division or unit if applicable.

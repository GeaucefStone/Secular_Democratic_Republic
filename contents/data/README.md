"monolith.blend" is intended as a blueprint that will be engraved with the SDR constitution on all four sides. 

The main body should be three and a half feet wide. 

Just less than an inch away, there should be a text-box. The SDR Constitution should be formatted to fill each side in four parts. 

Quartzite is a good texture for it. 

At the top should be an aluminum bronze pheonix.

# Sentinel of Liberty

This render is intended to be a model for a potential statue should any country rise and accept the SDR Constitution. 

The Sentinel of Liberty aims to be a 20 foot statue for capitol building. 

She would have a widows peak, her hair tied back for practical reasons, and wear Roman sandals and robes draped over one shoulder. 

She carries a bow and arrow, ready to defend herself as the visual manifestation of the SDR Constitution itself. 

The phrase on her pedestal should say "MI NE UNUE ATAKAS, SED MI DONAS LA FINAN BATON". It translates from Esparanto as "I do not strike first, but I will deliver the final blow". 

I cannot legally upload the model at this time, because it is made from Daz3D.

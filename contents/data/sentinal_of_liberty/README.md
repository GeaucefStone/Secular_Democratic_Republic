# Sentinel of Liberty

This render is intended to be a model for a potential statue should any country rise and accept the SDR Constitution. 

I first used Daz3D, and then have ChatGPT render on top of that to acheive the closest effect I can. 

The Sentinel of Liberty aims to be a 30 foot statue for capitol building. 

She would have a widows peak, her hair tied back for practical reasons, and wear Spartan sandals and robes. She should appear lean, but not overly muscular. She does not need the helmet, because much of her face will be hidden. 

I couldn't get ChatGPT to pose her exactly as I wanted. The Sentinel is suppose to rest the arrow against the bow without drawing it, but instead poses as if she is preparing to draw. 

She carries a bow and arrow, ready to defend herself as the visual manifestation of the SDR Constitution itself. 

The phrase on her pedestal should say "MI NE UNUE ATAKAS, SED MI DONAS LA FINAN BATON". It translates from Esparanto as "I do not strike first, but I will deliver the final blow". 

I legally could not upload the Daz3D model. However, I could hire someone to create a colored Blender file and upload it here when the time is right. 

## Material and Building

The statue itself should be aluminum-bronze, with some chromium and vanadium in the mixture. 

Each piece should be forged, with the edges lapping over each other to be welded. Gas Tungsten Arch Welding is compulsory.

As an elective, the eyes could be any translucent gem or glass the color of cyan. With the right technology, an LED from underneath could illuminate her eyes at night.

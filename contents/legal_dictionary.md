# LEGAL DICTIONARY OF THE SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

## PREAMBLE

This dictionary provides definitive interpretations for key terms within the SDR legal framework. It is designed to ensure consistent application of the law, guide judicial sentencing, and clarify the intent behind constitutional provisions. Terms are defined with precision to eliminate ambiguity and uphold the principles of justice enshrined in the supreme law.

---

### A

**Aggressor** - An individual who initiates an unprovoked, violent felony. This status triggers the Transfer of Liability Doctrine (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 6).

**Asylum** - Protection granted by the Republic to persons facing a credible threat of persecution in their country of origin for protected characteristics (Art. I, Sec. 17).

### B

**Bodily Autonomy** - The exclusive and inalienable right of every person over their own body, health decisions, and personal privacy. This right is absolute and prohibits medical mandates (Art. I, Sec. 6).

### C

**Castle Doctrine** - The principle that there is no duty to retreat from one's own home, or property one is authorized to control, when facing a threat (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 5).

**Citizens' Assembly** - A 1,000-member body selected by annual sortition with powers to investigate government branches, initiate impeachment, and veto regulations (Art. IV, Sec. 5).

**Cockpit Doctrine** - An extension of the Castle Doctrine that applies to movable property or a semi-enclosed conveyance, such as a vehicle or trailer, where there is no duty to retreat from an attack (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 5).

**Compressed Decision Environment** - A high-stress, rapidly unfolding situation where comprehensive threat assessment is impossible. Defensive actions are judged based on reasonable perception in the moment, not retrospective analysis (Est. *Highway Interceptor Case*).

**Conspiracy** - The deliberate planning and agreement between two or more persons to commit a felony, accompanied by a concrete overt act in furtherance of that agreement (Art. II, Sec. 11).

**Constitutional Mathematics** - A term describing the predictable, tiered, and often cumulative application of penalties and enhancements within the SDR justice system, leaving little room for arbitrary outcomes (Est. *Troll King Analysis*).

### D

**Doctrine of Substance Over Form** - The legal principle that the substance, economic reality, and actual purpose of an arrangement shall prevail over its legal form to prevent evasion of the law (Art. II, Sec. 12).

**Duty to Retreat** - The initial obligation in the tiered self-defense framework to attempt to safely avoid a confrontation if possible, before escalating to force (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 5).

### E

**Execution** - The lawful killing of a death row inmate or a war criminal.

**Exoneration** - The act of absolving an individual of guilt and lifting all relevant charges based on new evidence, which triggers a mandatory financial award for time falsely imprisoned. This is distinct from a pardon.

**Existential Self-Defense (Petrov Doctrine)** - Acts committed during escape from state-sanctioned persecution based on protected characteristics, which may qualify as justified self-defense even if they result in the death of state agents (Est. *Petrov vs. Extradition Treaty*).

### H

**Homicide** - The act of taking a life. Serves as the umbrella term for all forms of death caused by another person.

### M

**Manslaughter** - Unintentional homicide. This includes accidental deaths or killings committed in justified self-defense.

**Mass Murder** - The act of murdering multiple people. This crime always calls for execution.

**Militant Democracy** - A constitutional principle wherein the Republic proactively defends its democratic institutions and fundamental rights by disqualifying from power those who seek to use democratic means to abolish them (Art. I, Sec. 5; Art. VII, Sec. 5).

**Murder** - Deliberate homicide.

### P

**Pardon** - An executive act that neutralizes existing charges as if they never happened. This does not erase the individual's criminal record but restores full rights and removes them from prison. Contrast with **Exoneration**.

**Poisoned Chalice** - An anti-corruption mechanism where a public official who is offered a bribe may legally accept and retain it as evidence, leading to the asset's forfeiture and the briber's prosecution, while the compliant official is rewarded (Art. XII, Sec. 3).

**Proxicide** - The act of using another person as an instrument to commit murder. This includes murder-for-hire schemes or cult leaders ordering executions.

### R

**Reasonable Perception Standard** - The doctrine that defensive force is justified when an individual reasonably believes it is necessary to counter an imminent threat, based on the information available in the moment, regardless of the threat's ultimate authenticity (Est. *Highway Interceptor Case*).

### S

**Settled Medical Law** - A finding of medical fact (e.g., a treatment's efficacy) established by the Surgeon Court that is permanent and binding on all branches of government, unless superseded by new, overwhelming evidence (Art. VIII, Sec. 2).

**Stand Your Ground** - The principle that if a safe retreat is not possible or safe, an individual has no duty to retreat and may meet force with force, including lethal force if necessary (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 5).

### T

**Transfer of Liability Doctrine** - The principle that an aggressor who initiates a violent felony is held legally responsible for any death or injury that occurs as a direct result, even if the fatal blow is struck by a defender or law enforcement officer (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 6).

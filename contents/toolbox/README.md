# Academic Discourse Simulations

## Overview

This directory contains original HTML and CSS simulations designed for educational analysis of online discourse patterns. These are custom-built teaching tools created specifically for this project. Just embed necessary photos or videos, and screenshot or record them. 

Note: As of the first upload, these files are blank. The names have been carefully chosen to avoid copyright or trademark infringement. 

## Purpose

The simulations serve as visual aids to:
- Demonstrate common rhetorical patterns in controlled environments
- Provide consistent, reproducible examples for analysis
- Create clear visual references for textbook materials
- Avoid copyright issues associated with using real platform screenshots

## Content Description

### What These Files Are:
- **Original code** written specifically for this educational project
- **Generic UI designs** that don't replicate any specific platform
- **Teaching tools** for demonstrating discourse analysis concepts
- **Local simulation engines** for generating educational screenshots

### What These Files Are NOT:
- Functional websites for public deployment
- Copies of existing social media platforms
- Tools for harassment or impersonation
- Violations of any platform trademarks

## Usage Guidelines

### For Project Maintainers:
1. Run simulations locally to generate screenshots
2. Use screenshots in textbook examples and analysis
3. Modify source code to create new educational scenarios
4. Never deploy simulations to live websites

### For Contributors:
- You may adapt simulation code for educational purposes
- Maintain clear "ACADEMIC SIMULATION" disclaimers
- Keep all content fictional and educational
- Do not use real user data or identities

## Technical Details

### Code Philosophy:
- Written in vanilla HTML/CSS for maximum compatibility
- Self-contained with no external dependencies
- Designed for local execution only
- Clear visual indicators of simulation status

### Compliance Features:
- No platform-specific styling or branding
- Generic user interface patterns
- Prominent academic disclaimers
- Fictional content only

## License

All simulation code is original work licensed under the same terms as the main project. These are teaching tools, not functional applications.

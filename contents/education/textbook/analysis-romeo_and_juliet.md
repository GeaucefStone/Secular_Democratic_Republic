# Constitutional Textbook: Age of Consent & Sexual Offense Framework

## Article II, Section 6: Sexual Conduct & Age Protections

### Core Principles

The SDR Constitution establishes a balanced framework that:
- **Protects minors** from exploitation and predation by adults
- **Avoids over-criminalizing** consensual peer relationships among adolescents
- **Focuses enforcement resources** on relationships with significant power imbalances
- **Provides clear, predictable legal boundaries** for sexual conduct

### Tiered Protection System

#### 1. Peer Relationship Protections (Clause 1)
**Text**: "Sexual activity between consenting persons is not criminal provided the younger party is at least 13 years old and the age difference between them does not exceed two years."

**Purpose**: Recognizes that adolescents of similar age may engage in consensual exploration without the predatory dynamics that justify criminal intervention.

**Example**: A 15-year-old and 16-year-old in a relationship fall within this protection.

#### 2. Transitional Protection (Clause 2)
**Text**: "A person who is 19 years old is protected from prosecution for sexual activity with a partner who is less than two years younger than them, provided it is consensual."

**Purpose**: Prevents the automatic criminalization of relationships that were legal when both parties were minors and continue as they transition to adulthood.

**Example**: An 18-year-old high school senior dating a 17-year-old classmate would not face prosecution when they turn 19.

#### 3. Age of Consent & Predation Prevention (Clause 3)
**General Age of Consent**: 18 years old

**Enhanced Protection for Young Adults**: 
- Sexual activity between individuals under 21 and those over 25 is prohibited
- Three-month grace period provided when the older partner turns 25 to prevent automatic criminalization of existing relationships

**Rationale**: Protects young adults (18-20) from potential exploitation by significantly older individuals while recognizing that relationships with moderate age gaps may be consensual.

#### 4. Aggressor Clause (Clause 4)
**Text**: "In the event the younger party is the initiator and aggressor in a sexual assault, even if they were a minor at the time, the older victim will not face criminal charges for the non-consensual act."

**Purpose**: Ensures that actual victims of sexual assault are not prosecuted, regardless of age differences, when they are the non-consenting party.

### Registration Consequences

**Important Note**: Convictions under the peer protection clauses (1 & 2) do not require registration on the sex offender registry. This reflects the constitutional principle that these relationships, while technically violating the general age of consent, do not represent the predatory behavior that registry systems are designed to address.

### Philosophical Foundation

This framework embodies several key constitutional principles:

1. **Proportionality**: Legal consequences should match the actual harm caused
2. **Developmental Realism**: Laws should account for normal adolescent development
3. **Harm Reduction**: Focus enforcement on genuinely exploitative situations
4. **Legal Certainty**: Provide clear, predictable rules that citizens can understand and follow

### Implementation Guidelines

**For Law Enforcement**: Focus investigative resources on relationships with significant age gaps and potential power imbalances rather than peer relationships among minors.

**For Prosecutors**: Exercise discretion in cases falling within the protected categories, with presumption against prosecution for technical violations without evidence of coercion or exploitation.

**For Educators**: This legal framework should inform comprehensive sex education that teaches both legal boundaries and principles of consent, respect, and healthy relationships.

# Constitutional Analysis: Poetic Justice

## Judicial Sentencing Flexibility

The Constitution provides judges with significant discretion in sentencing under Article II. This allows for creatively tailored sentences that fit the crime. For example, in cases of retaliatory violence by landlords (Article X), a judge could, within their existing authority:

 - Sentence the individual to a term of imprisonment.

 - **Order, as a condition of parole, that the defendant pay a monthly restitution fee to the Public Housing Trust,** calculated as a percentage of the median rent.

This would create a powerful, poetically just outcome—using the logic of the rental market to hold the offender accountable—**without requiring any new constitutional text.** The system, as written, is robust enough to permit this level of nuanced justice.

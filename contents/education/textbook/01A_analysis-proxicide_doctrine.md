# Constitutional Analysis: The Proxicide Doctrine - From Street Crime to Total War

## Foundational Principle

Proxicide is the crime of wielding a human being as a weapon. The gravity of the offense escalates not merely with the number of victims, but with the *scale of instrumentalization* and the *corruption of systems*. It is a unified legal theory that applies from a single murder to genocide, recognizing that the core evil—the destruction of human agency for a lethal purpose—is the same.

## The Legal Definition

**Proxicide:** The act of using, manipulating, or directing another person as an instrument to cause death, where the perpetrator's actions are a proximate and foreseeable cause of the lethal outcome.

**Chain of Proxicide:** The doctrine establishing that liability flows upward to the individual with the highest authority and clearest intent, who sets a system of violence in motion. The political architect bears supreme responsibility.

## The Escalation Framework: A Tiered System of Guilt

### Tier 1: Individual Proxicide (The Civilian World)

**Scenario:** A gang leader orders a subordinate to kill a rival. The subordinate carries out the murder.

 - **Charge:** Proxicide

 - **Liability:**
  * **The Gang Leader (Proxicide):** He used a human being as a murder weapon. He is charged with murder as the principal.
  * **The Subordinate (Murder):** Charged with the physical act of murder. While a tool, they retain moral agency and are responsible for their actions.
  * **Sentencing Enhancement:** The gang leader's sentence is enhanced over that of the subordinate. His crime is considered more insidious because it corrupts another individual and operates from cowardice.

### Tier 2: Organizational Proxicide (The Criminal Enterprise)

**Scenario:** A drug cartel has a dedicated enforcement arm. The cartel boss sets a policy of killing informants. A lieutenant relays the order for a specific hit, which is carried out by a triggerman.

 - **Charges:** Proxicide + Criminal Conspiracy (Art. II, Sec. 11)

 - **Liability:**
  * **Cartel Boss (Chain Proxicide):** At the top of the chain. He weaponized the entire organization's policy.
  * **The Lieutenant (Proxicide):** The direct instrument-wielder in this instance.
  * **The Trigerman (Murder):** The physical instrument.

 - **Sentencing Enhancement:** The Conspiracy charge multiplies the penalties. The boss is liable for a pattern of proxicidal acts, not just one. The "Constitutional Mathematics" of the justice system applies severe, cumulative penalties.

### Tier 3: Institutional Proxicide (Corruption of State Power)

**Scenario:** A corrupt Mayor orders the Chief of Police to have a whistleblower killed. The Chief passes the order to a detective, who arranges for a hitman to do the deed.

 - **Charges:** Proxicide + Official Misconduct (Art. XII) + Conspiracy

 - **Liability:**
  * **The Mayor (Chain Proxicide):** Supreme liability. He has weaponized the institution of the state itself for murder. This is a capital offense under Article XII.
  * **The Police Chief & Detective (Proxicide):** Have become instruments of a corrupted state. Their status as public officials is a severe aggravating factor.
  * **The Hitman (Murder):** The final instrument.

 - **Sentencing Enhancement:** The violation of public trust moves this into the realm of the most serious crimes. The "Poisoned Chalice" doctrine (Art. XII, Sec. 3) would also apply if any bribery was involved. Life imprisonment or death is the expected outcome for the Mayor.

### Tier 4: Ideological Proxicide (The Pre-War Phase)

**Scenario:** A charismatic ideologue (e.g., Pastor Sterling) preaches a doctrine that declares a group of people "subhuman" and a threat to the nation. His followers, incited by this rhetoric, begin a campaign of targeted assassinations against members of that group.

 -   **Charges:** Incitement to Proxicide + Sedition (Art. I, Sec. 5) + Conspiracy

 -   **Liability:**
  * **The Ideologue (Chain Proxicide):** He has weaponized an ideology and his followers. While he may not have given a direct order, his speech was the proximate and foreseeable cause of the violence. He is charged for the deaths.
  * **The Followers (Murder/Proxicide):** Depending on their role—organizer or trigger-puller.

 -   **Sentencing Enhancement:** This is a pre-emptive strike by the "militant democracy." The state acts before the ideology can fully capture the state apparatus. A finding of guilt here by the Historian Court (Art. IX) leads to permanent disqualification from office and severe imprisonment, preventing the escalation to Tier 5.

### Tier 5: Systemic State Proxicide (Total War & Genocide)

**Scenario:** The ideologue from Tier 4 has now seized control of the state. He implements the "Final Solution," using the entire machinery of government—the bureaucracy, the military, the rail system, the industrial base—to systematically identify, round up, and exterminate a population.

**Charges:**

1. **Systemic Chain Proxicide** (The Master Charge)

2. **Genocide** (Crime against the victim group)

3. **Mass Proxicide** (Crime of methodology)

4. **Aggressive War Proxicide** (For all deaths in the ensuing global conflict)

5. **Conspiracy** (The planning phase)

 - **Liability:**
  * **The Leader (Hitler):** The absolute apex of the Chain of Proxicide. His guilt is total and encompasses every death caused by the system he architected.
  * **Administrators (Eichmann):** Charged with Mass Proxicide and Conspiracy. They operated the machine.
  * **Military Commanders:** Charged with Aggressive War Proxicide for the deaths of soldiers under their command and the civilians they killed, as they were instruments of the leader's proxicidal war.
  * **Low-Level Functionaries & Soldiers:** Charged based on specific actions, but their culpability is framed by the overarching proxicidal system they served.

 - **Sentencing Enhancement:** This is the maximum application of the law. A conviction on these charges represents the most severe judgment the SDR can render, invariably resulting in the death penalty for the leadership. The "Transfer of Liability" (Art. II, Sec. 9, Cl. 6) is applied at a societal scale: the initiator of the aggression is responsible for every single death that results.

## The Unifying Thread: The Corruption of Agency

What links a gang leader to a genocidal dictator is the **willful destruction of human agency for a lethal purpose.**

- **In Tier 1,** the gang leader corrupts the agency of one person.

- **In Tier 5,** the dictator corrupts the agency of an entire nation—turning citizens into killers, bureaucrats into accountants of death, and industries into factories for murder.

The SDR's legal framework is designed to recognize this common thread and scale its response accordingly. It understands that the man who uses another as a handgun and the man who uses a nation as a death camp are committing the same category of crime; the difference is one of scale, not kind. This allows for a consistent, principled, and devastatingly effective application of justice from the street level to the global stage.

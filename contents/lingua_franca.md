# SDR Constitution Language Policy Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the **multilingual governance framework** for the Secular Democratic Republic, balancing _practical communication needs_ with _cultural preservation_.

## Core Language Principles

### 1. Languages of Immediate Sovereignty & Safety (LISS)
- **Purpose**: Emergency response and critical public safety
- **Selection Criteria**: Maximum lifesaving coverage in post-ratification period
- **Implementation**:
  * All 911 operators **must** be fluent in designated LISS
  * Emergency alerts use LISS primarily
  * First responder training includes LISS competency

### 2. Language of Federal Administration (LFA)
- **Purpose**: Coherent federal governance and legal clarity
- **Implementation**:
  * All federal laws published in LFA
  * Legislative debates conducted in LFA
  * Federal services available in LFA

## Regional Language Protections

### Heritage Language Rights
- **Constitutional guarantee** of language preservation
- **Local government autonomy** for regional language designation
- **Education rights** in native languages

### Implementation Timeline
| Phase | Timeline | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Assessment** | Months 1-3 | Linguistic survey, LISS/LFA selection |
| **Transition** | Months 4-12 | Emergency systems update, federal transition |
| **Full Implementation** | Year 2+ | Education system rollout, regional adaptations |

## Education Requirements

### Civic Linguistic Competency
- **All graduates** must demonstrate fluency in:
  * At least one **Lingua Franca** (LISS or LFA)
  * One **Heritage or Global Language**

### Curriculum Structure
| Grade Level | Lingua Franca Focus | Heritage Language Focus |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| K-5 | Basic communication | Native language literacy |
| 6-8 | Academic proficiency | Cultural context |

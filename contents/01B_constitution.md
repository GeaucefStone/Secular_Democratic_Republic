# CONSTITUTION OF THE SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

---

## PREAMBLE

We, the people, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Secular Democratic Republic.

We recognize that a society is truly measured not by the wealth of its richest members, but by the security, dignity, and voice it affords all its members—especially those who are most vulnerable. Housing and healthcare are not commodities to be hoarded, nor privileges to be earned, but fundamental rights that form the bedrock of a just and prosperous society. A nation is strong not when its rulers are powerful, but when its citizens are empowered. We believe that every vote should count, that every voice should be heard, and that money should never speak louder than the people.

We further recognize that a just society is not one without crime, but one that responds to crime with wisdom, proportionality, and humanity—understanding that most crime arises from harm: trauma, addiction, poverty, mental illness. To punish the symptom without treating the cause is to ensure its return. We affirm that freedom of expression is the foundational right of a democracy, for without it we cannot govern ourselves, cannot hold power to account, and cannot seek the truth.

We hold that matters of faith and conscience are deeply personal and profoundly important. A just society must protect the right of every person to believe, to worship, to doubt, and to change their mind. It must also ensure that the state remains the servant of all people, regardless of their faith, and that no religious doctrine is imposed through the power of law.

We recognize that disability is not a deviation from the norm, but a natural part of the human experience—that people are disabled not by their impairments, but by barriers in society, and it is the duty of the state to identify and remove those barriers. We affirm that a just society is measured by how it treats its minorities—those who differ by race, ethnicity, language, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, caste, or culture. Democracy is not just rule by the majority; it is the protection of minorities.

We recognize that those who wield the power of the state over the bodies and liberty of others must be held to the highest standards of competence, integrity, and humanity. The role of police is not to fight a war, but to keep the peace; not to enforce dominance, but to protect rights; not to control the population, but to serve the community.

This Constitution establishes a reciprocal bond between the individual and the community. The state shall guarantee every person the resources for a stable home and a healthy life, a voice in their governance, and protection from harm. In return, every person accepts the responsibility of participating in and sustaining this system for future generations. We affirm that human dignity is inviolable, and that the power of the state is always in service to the people.

The large size of our sortition-based branches is deliberate and essential. One thousand citizens in each state's Citizens' Assembly, five hundred in the Worker's Branch, five hundred in the Historian Branch—these numbers are not arbitrary. They are chosen to enable these bodies to dispatch investigative committees, to travel where evidence leads, to conduct hearings across the Republic, and to maintain continuous oversight through rotating panels while preserving institutional memory. A small body cannot investigate a large state. These branches are designed to be mobile, active, and present wherever the people's business requires them.

## ARTICLE I: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS & PROTECTIONS

### Section 1: Universal Equal Protection

1. All persons within the jurisdiction of the Republic are equal before the law and entitled to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, age, disability, citizenship status, or any other characteristic.

2. **Protection from Economic Penalty Due to Family Status:** Under no circumstance shall a person's compensation, accrued benefits, or standing be reduced because of pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, or the taking of legally protected parental or family leave. Upon return to their position, such persons shall resume their compensation and benefits at not less than the previous level. This right is non-waivable and any agreement to the contrary is void.

### Section 2: Separation of Temple and State

1. The Republic shall establish no official religion nor endorse, favor, or promote any religious doctrine or institution.

2. No religious texts, prayers, or practices shall form part of the curriculum, ceremonies, or daily operations of public educational institutions.

3. Private religious schools may operate but shall receive no public funding beyond standard nutritional and health support programs available to all educational institutions.

4. No public funds shall be used for religious purposes, and no individual shall be compelled to participate in religious observance.

5. **Taxation of Large-Scale Religious Entities:**

 - **Principle:** Religious institutions are community organizations. When their scale, wealth, and operations exceed those of a typical community organization and enter the realm of major commercial enterprise, they incur an obligation to contribute equitably to the society that hosts them.

 - **Taxation:** Upon classification, the entity shall be subject to standard corporate income tax on all revenue, and property taxes on all its holdings, at the rates applicable to for-profit corporations.

 - **Transparency:** All institutions meeting one of the criteria above must file annual public financial disclosures, subject to audit by the state revenue service, to ensure accurate assessment.

6. **The "No Special Access" Rule:**

 - Religious institutions apply for building permits under the exact same process and criteria as any other private social or community assembly. No fast-tracking, no special exemptions from standard safety, environmental, or infrastructure impact reviews.

 - **The "Scale and Footprint" Regulation:**

  * **Purpose:** To prevent the construction of massive, domineering structures that visually and culturally claim a territory.
  * **Mechanism:** Zoning codes can legally regulate the height, square footage, and lot coverage of all buildings in a zone. A mosque, temple, or church cannot exceed the size limitations imposed on other assembly halls in that same zone.

 - **The "Buffer Zone" for Residential and Civic Core Areas:**

  * **Purpose:** To maintain the secular sanctity of the most fundamental community spaces.
  * **Mechanism:** Zoning can establish that within a certain radius of public schools, courthouses, and legislative buildings, no land may be used for purpose-built religious structures.

 - **The "Industrial/Commercial" for Large Structures:**

  * **Purpose:** To acknowledge the reality that a large religious complex operates like a major institution, not a quiet community house.
  * **Mechanism:** Any religious structure intended to serve a congregation over a certain size must be built in zones designated for commercial assembly or light industrial use.

### Section 3: Freedom of Expression & Belief

1. Freedom of thought, conscience, speech, press, assembly, association, and religion shall be inviolable.

2. These freedoms may be subject only to such reasonable limitations as are necessary to prevent imminent lawless action, incitement to violence, defamation, or genuine threats to national security.

3. There shall be no law against blasphemy, as such would violate free speech.

4. A judicial finding that an individual has publicly engaged in incitement to violence or hatred based on a protected characteristic shall render that person ineligible to hold public office.

### Section 4: Resolution of Conflicting Rights

1. Where the exercise of one fundamental right unavoidably infringes upon the core of another, the state, through its courts, shall seek a resolution that minimizes the impairment to both.

2. In such conflicts, no right is automatically superior. The court shall consider:

 - The historical context and vulnerability of the parties involved.
 - The availability of reasonable alternatives for each party.
 - The principle of least restrictive means.

3. This section shall not be used to justify the suspension of rights under Article I, Section 17, nor shall it be used to elevate property or commercial interests above the rights to bodily autonomy, freedom of conscience, or protection from discrimination.

### Section 5: Safeguarding Democratic Integrity

1. Any person who, through public speech, association, or action, has demonstrated a sustained adherence to an ideology that explicitly advocates for the abolition of democratic institutions, the establishment of a dictatorship, or the denial of fundamental rights and equal protection to any group based on a characteristic protected under Article I, Section 1, shall be ineligible to hold public office.

2. **Specific Prohibited Ideologies (Non-Expandable List):**

The following ideologies, and ONLY the following, are disqualified:

 - **Fascism:** An ideology that advocates for single-party authoritarian dictatorship, suppression of political opposition through violence, subordination of individual rights to the state, and ultranationalism with racial or ethnic supremacy.

 - **Nazism and Neo-Nazism:** As defined by historical record.

 - **Theocratic Absolutism:** An ideology that advocates for enforcement of religious law as state law, denial of rights to non-believers, and state enforcement of religious doctrine.

 - **Explicit Anti-Democratic Authoritarianism:** Direct advocacy for military coup, explicit call for suspension of elections, or advocacy for violent overthrow of constitutional order outside the procedures and safeguards established in this Constitution.

3. **What Is NOT Disqualified:**

 - The following shall NEVER be grounds for disqualification:
  * Advocacy for economic systems, including socialism, capitalism, mutualism, or any other economic model.
  * Advocacy for expansion or restriction of government power within constitutional bounds.
  * Criticism of existing institutions or advocacy for their reform through democratic and lawful means.
  * Religious belief or practice that does not seek state enforcement of doctrine or denial of rights to non-believers.
  * Any ideology that operates within democratic and constitutional means, however sharply it criticizes the government or prevailing social order.

4. **Burden of Proof and Standard of Evidence:**

 - Petitioners must prove disqualification by clear and convincing evidence.
 - Evidence must include explicit public statements by the individual.
 - A single statement, however extreme, shall be insufficient; petitioners must demonstrate a sustained pattern of advocacy.
 - Petitioners must demonstrate current adherence, not mere past association or membership.
 - All ambiguous cases shall be resolved in favor of eligibility.

5. **Automatic Sunset and Review:**

 - The disqualified individual may petition for removal of disqualification once every five years upon presentation of new evidence demonstrating changed adherence or good-faith renunciation.

6. A finding of ineligibility under this section may only be made by the Supreme Court, following a public, adversarial hearing initiated by the Citizens' Assembly or by a majority vote of Congress. The burden of proof shall be on the petitioners to demonstrate a clear and present danger to the constitutional order.

7. This provision shall not be used to suppress mere political dissent or unpopular opinions that stop short of advocating for the destruction of constitutional democracy.

8. **Saving Clause for Non-Officeholders:**

 - Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize the punishment, censorship, or restriction of any person's freedom of speech, association, or belief solely on the basis of their adherence to an ideology described in Clause 2, unless that person is seeking or holding public office.

 - No finding of ineligibility under this Section shall be used as evidence in any criminal or civil proceeding against the disqualified individual for conduct occurring prior to or independently of their candidacy.

 - The rights guaranteed under Article I, Section 3 remain fully operative for all persons not subject to a disqualification order, and for disqualified persons in all contexts unrelated to holding public office.

### Section 6: Bodily Autonomy & Medical Privacy

1. Every person has exclusive and inalienable rights over their own body, health decisions, and personal privacy.

2. Healthcare information shall remain strictly private and confidential, except:

 - Pursuant to valid judicial warrant based on probable cause.
 - For mandatory testing following accidents causing serious injury or significant property damage, as defined by law.
 - For anonymous, non-identifying public health reporting of communicable diseases.

3. The rights to abortion and voluntary sterilization are recognized as fundamental components of bodily autonomy. The denial of timely access to these services by any institution operating within or regulated by the public health system constitutes a violation of this section.

4. **Guarantee of Access to Reproductive Services:**

 - The rights to abortion and voluntary sterilization are recognized as fundamental components of bodily autonomy. The state bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring effective and universal access to these services.

 - **Prohibition of Unreasonable Denial:** No healthcare provider shall deny a patient's request for a legally available elective procedure, including voluntary sterilization, based on the provider's personal judgment regarding the patient's age, perceived future desires, marital status, parity, or spousal consent. A provider may only deny such a request for bona fide, documented clinical contraindications that present a significant and immediate risk to the patient's life.

 - **Immediate Duty to Refer:** If a healthcare provider is unwilling to perform a legally available procedure for any reason, including conscientious objection or lack of specific training, they have an immediate, non-delegable duty to facilitate a seamless and timely referral to a willing and qualified provider. This referral must be provided without delay, administrative impediment, or additional cost to the patient.

 - **Institutional Liability:** Any public institution or private entity receiving public funding that fails to guarantee access as outlined in this Clause shall be deemed in violation of this section. The institution itself bears ultimate legal and financial responsibility for any denial or undue delay of care caused by its policies or failure of its referral system.

5. **Enhanced Accountability for Denial of Care:**

 - A healthcare provider who willfully and knowingly violates Clause 4 of this section by denying a procedure without a bona fide clinical justification, or who violates Clause 4 by obstructing a referral, shall be subject to professional disciplinary action, including mandatory retraining and the potential suspension or revocation of their medical license.

 - In addition to professional discipline, a provider found in violation shall be civilly liable to the patient for significant damages, including compensation for emotional distress and any additional costs incurred.

 - A pattern of such violations within a healthcare institution shall trigger a mandatory investigation by the relevant state authority and may result in the suspension of public funding and the initiation of criminal proceedings against responsible administrators for systemic deprivation of constitutional rights.

6. **Prohibition on Bodily Mandates:**

 - **General Rule:** Neither the state, nor any institution acting under its authority, shall mandate any medical treatment, procedure, pharmaceutical, implant, genetic therapy, or any other substance or intervention that enters, alters, or is performed upon the body of a non-consenting individual. This right is absolute and is not negated by any finding of safety, efficacy, or medical necessity. It may not be suspended, even under a declaration of emergency.

 - **Narrow Emergency Exception (Life-Saving Only):** In cases where an individual meets ALL of the following criteria:
  * Suffering from an imminently fatal condition, with death reasonably expected within 72 hours.
  * Incapacitated and unable to make or communicate an informed decision.
  * No advance directive, living will, or other legally binding instruction prohibiting the specific intervention is known to exist.
  * The proposed intervention has a greater than ninety percent (90%) proven success rate in preserving life under the presenting circumstances.

Then: Emergency medical intervention may be administered without the individual's contemporaneous consent.

This exception applies exclusively to individual emergency medical care. It shall never be construed to authorize population-wide mandates, prophylactic treatment of healthy persons, or any intervention not meeting the strict criteria above.

 - **Existential Pandemic Exception (Absolute Last Resort):** If, and only if, a communicable disease meets ALL of the following criteria:
  * Documented case fatality rate exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) among immunocompetent adults.
  * Efficient and sustained airborne transmission.
  * No practicable means of effective quarantine or isolation exist to contain spread.
  * A safe and effective pharmaceutical intervention exists with a documented severe adverse event rate below five percent (5%).
  * A state of emergency has been lawfully declared under Article VI, Section 1.
  * Three-quarters (¾) of the Citizens' Assembly, following public hearings and adversarial expert testimony, votes to authorize the exception.
  * The Supreme Court certifies, in a published opinion, that the criteria are met and no less restrictive means are available.

Then: The state may mandate the specific pharmaceutical intervention for essential workers only, and only for the duration strictly necessary to abate the existential threat.

This exception shall never apply to:

  * The general population.
  * Children under the age of majority.
  * Pregnant or breastfeeding individuals.
  * Individuals with documented medical contraindications.
  * Any intervention not specifically authorized by the Citizens' Assembly vote.

 - **Limitation Preserved:** Nothing in this Clause shall be construed to limit the state's power to enact and enforce isolation, quarantine, or other public health measures that restrict movement, association, or activity to prevent the spread of contagious disease, provided such measures do not compel a specific medical intervention as defined in the General Rule above.

### Section 7: Environmental Rights

1. Every person has the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.

2. The state shall act as trustee of natural resources for present and future generations.

3. Environmental impact assessments shall be required for major public and private projects.

### Section 8: Digital Privacy & Autonomy

1. The privacy of personal digital data and communications shall be inviolable, unless the individual is subject to a criminal investigation or is currently on parole or probation.

2. Bulk data collection by the state is prohibited, unless an individual is subject to a search warrant or monitoring.

3. Individuals have the right to access, control, and delete their personal data.

4. **Limited Monitoring on State Networks for Severe Threats:**

 - **Authorization and Scope:**
  * On its own digital networks, the state is authorized to employ automated monitoring systems for the sole purpose of identifying credible, imminent threats.
  * On state-owned devices, this authority is active only while the device is connected to a state network.

 - **Two-Stage Monitoring Process:**
  * **Stage 1 - Transient Analysis:** The system shall operate primarily in a transient, non-recording analysis mode. In this mode, it analyzes communications in real-time but does not record or retain them.
  * **Stage 2 - Judicial Authorization to Record:** If the system's transient analysis identifies a communication with a high-confidence match to a defined threat, it may preserve that specific communication in a secure, encrypted queue.
  * The system must immediately, and automatically, petition a designated judge for a "Recording Warrant." This petition must include the preserved communication and the AI's justification. No human agent may review the preserved communication until the warrant is granted.
  * A judge must rule on the petition within 12 hours. If the warrant is granted, the communication is lawfully recorded and a targeted investigation may begin. If the warrant is denied, the preserved communication must be immediately and irreversibly deleted. All other communications remain unrecorded.

 - **The Absolute Home Privacy Firewall:**
  * No state-owned device shall activate its microphone, camera, or location services for monitoring when located within a private residence, unless pursuant to a specific, traditional warrant targeting that residence for a separate investigation.
  * The limited monitoring authorized above is explicitly prohibited from being activated on a device while it is in a private residence.

 - **Oversight and Penalties:**
  * The threat definitions and AI models must be publicly disclosed and audited annually by the Scientific Branch and the relevant Citizens' Assembly.
  * Any recording that occurs without a Recording Warrant, or any violation of the Home Privacy Firewall, constitutes a felony, and evidence obtained shall be presumptively inadmissible.

### Section 9: Protection Against Synthetic Media and Digital Forgery

1. **Right to Digital Identity and Consent:** Every person has an inviolable right to their own likeness, voice, and digital identity. The non-consensual creation, alteration, or distribution of a realistic synthetic media representation of an individual ("DeepFake") is a severe violation of personal autonomy.

2. **Categorization of Offenses:** The misuse of synthetic media shall be categorized and penalized based on intent and harm:

 - **Non-Consensual Intimate Depictions:** The creation or distribution of sexually explicit DeepFakes without consent shall be a felony, punishable by imprisonment and significant fines, recognizing it as a form of sexual abuse and harassment.

 - **Defamatory and Reputational Harm:** The creation or distribution of DeepFakes with the intent to defame, harass, or cause severe emotional distress shall be subject to enhanced penalties, significantly greater than those for equivalent libel or slander committed with traditional media.

 - **Fraud and Election Interference:** The use of DeepFakes to commit fraud, impersonate a public official, or interfere with an election or official government proceeding shall be a felony punishable by imprisonment commensurate with the threat posed to national security and democratic integrity.

 - **Blackmail or Extortion:** This is the most serious offense, as it violates human dignity for financial gain, subject to the penalties in Article II.

3. **Strict Liability for Malicious Distribution:** Any person who knowingly distributes a DeepFake they are aware is maliciously created shall be subject to criminal liability as an accomplice.

4. **Mandatory Disclosure:** All synthetic media that has been materially altered in a way that could fool a reasonable person must be clearly and prominently labeled as such. The use of undisclosed DeepFakes for commercial or political communication shall be strictly prohibited.

5. **Affirmative Defense:** It shall be an affirmative defense to charges under this section that the media was clearly labeled as synthetic, used for obvious parody, satire, or artistic expression, or created with the explicit, verifiable consent of the individual depicted.

### Section 10: The Right to Self-Defense and Bearing Arms

1. The right of the people to keep and bear small arms, including all legally possessed firearms operable by a single person, for self-defense, security, and other lawful purposes shall not be infringed. This right pertains to individual weapons and shall not be construed to apply to crew-served weapons, ordnance, or weapons of mass destruction.

2. Any person of legal age to operate a motor vehicle shall have the unrestricted right to acquire, possess, and carry non-lethal defensive instruments. No license shall be required for such instruments.

3. **Regulated Access to Lethal Arms:**

 - Citizens aged 18 and older shall have the right to keep and bear such arms.
 - The purchase of firearms by citizens between ages 18 and 25 may require a license, as determined by law.
 - Any licensing process, if enacted, shall be free of charge, shall certify completion of safety and legal training, and shall not be used as a mechanism for discriminatory denial.
 - A license solely for the ownership of a firearm already legally possessed shall never be imposed.

4. This right shall not extend to individuals convicted of violent felonies or who are subject to active protective orders for domestic violence, as determined by a court of law.

5. **Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs):**

 - **Purpose:** To prevent individuals who pose a significant and immediate danger to themselves or others from accessing lethal arms during a period of crisis.
 - **Temporary Order:** A law enforcement officer or immediate family member may petition a court for a temporary ERPO. Upon a finding of probable cause, a judge may issue an order, valid for not more than 14 days, requiring the surrender of firearms pending a full hearing. This order may be issued ex parte.
 - **Full Hearing:** Before the temporary order expires, a full hearing must be held where the subject has the right to be present, to legal counsel, and to confront evidence. A final ERPO may be issued for up to one year based on clear and convincing evidence.
 - **Safeguards:** Knowingly filing a false petition shall be a felony. All surrendered weapons must be promptly returned upon the order's expiration.

6. **Municipal Regulation of Discharge:**

 - The right to bear arms shall not be construed to prohibit a municipality from regulating the discharge of firearms within its jurisdiction to ensure public safety.
 - Such regulations may include, but are not limited to:
  * Prohibiting discharge within a specified minimum distance of any occupied dwelling, school, or public park without the express written consent of the owner.
  * Enacting and enforcing reasonable noise ordinances that apply to the sound of gunfire.
  * Requiring the use of a certified backstop or range safety system for any target practice on residential property.
 - These regulations shall be presumed constitutional if they are narrowly tailored to address documented public safety risks and do not function as a de facto blanket ban on the lawful use of firearms for self-defense or recreation within the municipality.

### Section 11: Right to Domestic Privacy

1. Every person has the right to privacy within their lawful residence and its immediate grounds.

2. This right includes a reasonable expectation of privacy from unaided surveillance in outdoor areas such as yards, patios, and balconies.

3. To secure this right, residents shall have the right to reasonable modifications, such as the construction of privacy-enhancing fences, walls, or vegetation screens, for the duration of their residence.

4. The state, through the Public Housing Trust or other relevant bodies, shall facilitate these modifications upon resident request. Local ordinances may establish reasonable regulations regarding the height, materials, and safety of such structures, but shall not prohibit them outright or regulate them in a manner that effectively nullifies this right.

5. **Limitation for Supervised Individuals:**

 - Persons serving a term of probation or parole as a condition of their release from incarceration shall have a diminished expectation of domestic privacy.
 - As a condition of their release, such individuals may be subject to warrantless searches of their person, residence, and vehicle by their supervising officer, provided the search is based on reasonable suspicion of a violation of their release conditions and is not conducted for the purpose of harassment.

### Section 12: Right to Dissolve Marriage (No-Fault Divorce)

1. The right to dissolve a marriage is inviolable. No person shall be compelled by the state to remain legally married against their will.

2. The Republic shall recognize and facilitate no-fault divorce. Upon the petition of either party to a marriage, the state shall grant a dissolution of the marriage without requiring the petitioner to prove wrongdoing by the other party.

3. The primary considerations of the court in a divorce proceeding shall be the equitable division of marital property, and the welfare and best interests of any dependent children. The court shall not deny or delay a divorce decree based on the objection or lack of consent of the other party.

### Section 13: Freedom of Private Relationship Structures

1. The state shall not criminalize or penalize private, consensual relationships between adults, regardless of the number of participants.

2. No person shall be prosecuted for the crime of adultery, cohabitation, or polygamy based solely on the private, consensual structure of their relationships.

3. The legal recognition of marriage by the state is limited to the union of two persons for the purposes of defining next-of-kin, inheritance, tax status, and parental rights. This legal construct is separate from religious or social definitions of marriage.

4. Adults in multi-partner relationships shall have the right to enter into private contracts to define the terms of their shared life, including property rights, financial obligations, and medical decision-making authority. Such contracts shall be enforceable in civil court, subject to standard contract law principles and protections against fraud and coercion.

### Section 14: Suspension of Rights During Emergency

1. The fundamental rights enumerated in this Article, with the sole exception of the right to life and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, may be temporarily suspended but not terminated, to the extent strictly necessary to address an existential threat to the nation during a formally declared state of emergency under Article VI.

2. Any such suspension must be:

 - Proportional to the severity of the threat.
 - Limited in duration to the active declaration of emergency.
 - Subject to immediate and continuous review by the Supreme Court to ensure it does not exceed the strict necessities of the situation.

3. The rights to Bodily Autonomy (Section 6) and Domestic Privacy (Section 11) are granted the highest level of protection. Any suspension of these specific rights requires an additional, specific declaration by the Citizens' Assembly with a ⅔ majority vote, and may only be authorized for the narrowest and most critical of purposes.

4. **Penalty for Abuse:** Any public official who willfully and knowingly declares an emergency or suspends rights under this section without a legitimate, good-faith belief in an existential threat, or who suspends rights beyond what is strictly necessary, is guilty of a supreme offense against the state. Upon conviction, they shall be subject to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or, if the abuse resulted in widespread loss of life or the permanent dissolution of a fundamental right, the death penalty.

### Section 15: Right to Safe Emancipation for Minors

1. **Right to Petition:**

 - Any minor aged 16 or older who can demonstrate to a court, through clear and convincing evidence, that their place of residence poses a demonstrable and severe threat to their physical safety or psychological integrity, shall have the right to petition for legal emancipation. Such threats include, but are not limited to, abuse, neglect, exposure to substance abuse, violence, or being forced into a marriage arrangement.
 - Forced marriage shall always subject parents and the would-be spouse to the maximum penalty. The victim can file for their parents' early release after age 25.

2. **Guaranteed Counsel:** The state shall provide an attorney to the minor at no cost to assist in the preparation and presentation of their petition to the court. The court shall prioritize the swift adjudication of such petitions.

3. **Limited Scope of Emancipation:** A grant of emancipation under this section is specifically for the purpose of establishing a separate, safe residence and managing the finances necessary to support it. It does not constitute a grant of the full age of majority. Emancipated minors under this section remain subject to all other laws pertaining to minors, including compulsory education laws.

4. **Economic Protections:** A minor emancipated under this section shall be exempt from all residential property tax and shall be eligible for state support to ensure access to adequate housing, as guaranteed by Article III.

5. **Consequence for Guardians:** A finding by the court that justifies emancipation under this section may serve as grounds for a separate criminal investigation or child endangerment proceedings against the parent or guardian, at the discretion of the relevant authorities.

### Section 16: Rights of Immigrant Children and Youth

1. **Birthright Citizenship:** Any child born within the territory of the Republic shall be a citizen thereof, subject to the jurisdiction thereof, regardless of the citizenship or immigration status of the child's parents.

2. **Guaranteed Legal Residency for Minors:**

 - Every minor under the age of 18 who is physically present within the jurisdiction of the Republic, and who is not a citizen, shall be granted immediate legal residency.
 - This status shall be automatically maintained until the individual reaches the age of 25.

3. **Pathway to Citizenship:**

 - Individuals granted residency under this section shall have the right to apply for citizenship at any time after reaching the age of 18.
 - The process for application must be free of charge, and may only require demonstration of good character and a commitment to the principles of the Constitution.

4. **Protection from Deportation:** No individual who was granted legal residency as a minor under this section shall be subject to deportation or removal from the Republic before reaching the age of 25, provided they have not been convicted of a violent felony.

### Section 17: Right to Asylum from Persecution

1. Any person who faces a credible threat of persecution, including state-sanctioned violence or execution, in their country of origin for their membership in a group, or for an immutable or fundamental characteristic, that is protected from discrimination under Article I, Section 1 of this Constitution, shall be granted asylum in the Republic.

2. A person claiming asylum under this section shall be given a presumption of credibility. The burden of proof shall be on the state to rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.

3. Asylum claims made under this section shall be processed in an expedited manner. Applicants shall be granted temporary legal residency, the right to work, and access to essential services until their claim is adjudicated.

4. No person shall be deported, extradited, or otherwise returned to a territory where they would face a credible threat of persecution as defined in this section.

### Section 18: Law Enforcement Identification and Transparency

1. **Principle of Identifiable Authority:** No agent of the state, including any law enforcement officer, peacekeeper, or member of the security services, shall be permitted to conceal their identity while interacting with the public or executing their duties.

2. **Mandatory Identification:**

 - All uniforms must clearly display a unique, legible badge number or service identifier.
 - Upon request by any member of the public, an officer must verbally state their full badge number and surname.

3. **Limited Exemption for Facial Concealment:**

 - The concealment of an officer's face is permitted only when there is a specific, articulable, and credible threat to that officer's physical safety that would be mitigated by facial concealment, or for the purpose of operating in an environment requiring biological containment.
 - Even under this exemption, the officer's badge number must remain fully visible, and the reason for the concealment must be documented in a subsequent activity report.

4. **Prohibition on Anonymous Force:** The deployment of any unit whose standard operating procedure includes the routine concealment of all identifying features is strictly forbidden. The state's power must always have a name and a number.

5. **Penalty for Violation:** Any officer who willfully conceals their identity or badge number in violation of this section shall be subject to immediate suspension and disciplinary action. Any evidence gathered or action taken by an officer who is in violation of this section at the time of the incident shall be presumptively inadmissible in any proceeding.

6. **Limited Exemption for Covert Operations:**

 - **Authorization:** The routine concealment of identity by a law enforcement officer is permitted only pursuant to a Covert Operations Warrant issued by a panel of three judges from a designated security court.
 - **Necessity Requirement:** A warrant may only be issued upon a finding of specific, articulable, and credible evidence that:
  * A severe felony, as defined in Article II, is being planned or committed by a structured, clandestine organization, and
  * Conventional investigative techniques are insufficient to uncover the conspiracy, and
  * The concealment of the officer's identity is strictly necessary to prevent imminent violence or the dissolution of a fundamental right.
 - **Scope and Limitation:**
  * The warrant shall specify the named targets, the specific criminal organization, the duration of the authorization (not to exceed 90 days, renewable only upon a new finding), and the specific investigative acts permitted.
  * This authorization does not permit the officer to entrap, incite, or initiate criminal activity. Its sole purpose is the passive gathering of intelligence.
  * All evidence gathered by an officer operating under this warrant shall be presumptively inadmissible unless the prosecution can demonstrate strict adherence to its terms.

7. **Oversight and Penalty:**

 - A full, unredacted record of all activities conducted under this warrant shall be sealed and submitted to the oversight committee of the Citizens' Assembly upon the operation's conclusion.
 - Any officer who willfully operates outside the scope of a Covert Operations Warrant, or any official who approves a warrant in bad faith, shall be subject to the enhanced penalties of Article II, Section 3.

### Section 19: Rights of Persons with Disabilities

1. **Affirmative Right to Flourish:** Every person has the right to live with dignity, to develop their personality, and to flourish as an equal member of society. The State shall guarantee this right to all persons, including those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, by proactively identifying and eliminating barriers to full and equal participation.

2. **Freedom from Discrimination and the Duty of Reasonable Accommodation:**

 - It is unlawful to discriminate against any person on the basis of disability in employment, education, housing, healthcare, transportation, access to public services, and the administration of justice.
 - All public entities and private entities offering public accommodations have a mandatory duty to provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities. This duty is enforceable, and the burden of proving that an accommodation imposes an "undue hardship" shall be a high bar, resting on the entity denying the accommodation.
 - A state-funded Central Accommodation Fund shall be established to assist small businesses and public institutions in covering the costs of significant accommodations, removing financial capacity as a justification for undue hardship.

3. **Legal Capacity and Supported Decision-Making:**

 - All persons enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. Plenary guardianship that removes legal personhood is abolished.
 - Every person has the right to be recognized as a full legal actor. The state shall ensure that persons with disabilities who require assistance in exercising their legal capacity have access to supported decision-making arrangements of their choice, in which a trusted supporter assists them in understanding, making, and communicating decisions, while the individual retains their full legal capacity and final decision-making authority.

4. **Right to Live in the Community:**

 - Persons with disabilities have the right to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an equal basis with others, and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement.
 - No public funds shall be used to construct or maintain new segregated, long-term care institutions. The state shall develop a comprehensive system of personalized home- and community-based services, including personal assistance, accessible housing, and community support networks, to ensure this right is effective.

5. **Inclusive Education:**

 - The State shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels. The presumption of placement for every child, regardless of disability, shall be in a general education classroom in their local school.
 - Schools have a duty to collaborate and provide necessary supports, accommodations, and specialized staff within the mainstream classroom to facilitate effective education.

6. **Universal Design as a Guiding Principle:** Universal Design shall be a guiding principle for all new public infrastructure, services, technology, and information, ensuring they are usable by all people to the greatest extent possible without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

### Section 20: Right and Protection of Whistleblowers

1. **The Public's Right to Know:** The people have a fundamental right to be informed of wrongdoing, corruption, gross mismanagement, criminal activity, or dangers to public health and safety within any institution, public or private, that operates under the authority or regulation of the Republic.

2. **Protected Acts:** Any person who, based on a reasonable, good-faith belief, discloses information about an activity, policy, or practice that they believe constitutes a violation of law, regulation, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a gross waste of public funds, shall be protected from retaliation. Protected disclosures include, but are not limited to, reports made to:

 - A supervisor or internal reporting body.
 - A law enforcement or regulatory agency.
 - The Citizens' Assembly or its designated investigative committee.
 - The press or the public, if internal channels are ineffective, obstructed, or if the threat is imminent.

3. **Absolute Protection from Retaliation:**

 - No person shall be subject to prosecution, dismissal, demotion, suspension, harassment, blacklisting, or any other form of retaliation by their employer, the state, or any other entity for making a protected disclosure.
 - The burden of proof shall be on the employer or the state to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that any adverse action taken against a whistleblower was for a legitimate, independent reason wholly unrelated to the protected disclosure.

4. **Monetary Reward and Restitution:**

 - A whistleblower whose disclosure leads to a successful prosecution, a significant monetary recovery for the state, or the prevention of substantial public harm shall be entitled to a significant percentage of the funds recovered or a substantial state-funded reward, as determined by law.
 - Any whistleblower who suffers retaliation shall be entitled to full reinstatement, triple back-pay, compensation for all damages (including emotional distress), and attorney's fees.

5. **Criminal Penalty for Retaliators:** Any individual, whether a public official or private manager, who knowingly and willfully engages in the retaliation of a whistleblower shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and permanent disqualification from holding any position of public trust or managing the labor of others.

### Section 21: Right to Timely Forensic Investigation in Sexual Assault Cases

1. **The Right to a Functional Investigation:** Any person who reports a sexual assault to law enforcement has the right to a thorough and timely investigation. The state's failure to process and analyze forensic evidence constitutes a denial of this right and an abdication of its duty to provide equal protection under the law.

2. **Mandatory Processing of Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence (SAFE Kits):**

 - All Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) kits, commonly known as "rape kits," collected pursuant to a reported assault shall be submitted to an accredited forensic laboratory within thirty (30) days of their collection.
 - The forensic analysis of a submitted SAFE kit must be completed, and the results entered into relevant law enforcement databases, within ninety (90) days of its submission to the laboratory, barring exceptional and documented circumstances that prevent processing, which must be reviewed by a court.

3. **Statewide Tracking System:**

 - The state shall establish and maintain a centralized, electronic tracking system for all SAFE kits.
 - This system shall allow a victim, through a secure and private access code, to monitor the status and location of their kit from collection through to final analysis, without requiring direct contact with investigating officers.

4. **Annual Audit and Public Reporting:**

 - The Citizens' Assembly, through its investigative powers, shall commission an annual public audit of the state's compliance with this section.
 - The audit shall report the number of kits collected, submitted, processed, and remaining backlogged, and shall identify any systemic failures or resource shortages.

5. **Cause of Action and Enforcement:**

 - A victim, or the Citizens' Assembly on behalf of the public interest, may bring a cause of action against the relevant law enforcement agency or the state for failure to comply with the time limits mandated in Clause 2.
 - A court finding of a violation shall result in a mandatory writ of mandamus compelling immediate action and the allocation of necessary funds to clear the backlog. The responsible public officials shall be subject to professional discipline and may be held in contempt of court.

### Section 22: Right to Organize, Unionize, and Engage in Collective Action

1. **Fundamental Right to Unionize:** Employees shall have the fundamental right to self-organization; to form, join, and assist labor unions; to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing; and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid, collective bargaining, and other protection.

2. **Protection from Interference and Retaliation:**

 - It shall be unlawful for any employer, public or private, to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in this section.
 - No person shall be discriminated against, discharged, or otherwise retaliated against by their employer for organizing, joining a union, or participating in protected collective action, including strikes.

3. **Duty to Bargain in Good Faith:** Where a union has been certified as the representative of a majority of employees in an appropriate unit, the employer shall have a mandatory duty to bargain collectively with such representatives in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.

4. **Right to Strike:** The right to strike is an essential and inviolable component of collective action. Employees shall have the right to engage in peaceful strikes, picketing, and other forms of work stoppage. This right shall not be infringed, except in circumstances of a formally declared national emergency under Article VI where such action would directly and imminently endanger national security or public health in a manner that cannot be mitigated by other means.

5. **Enforcement and Remedies:**

 - Violations of this section shall be investigated and remedied by the Worker's Branch, which shall have the power to issue cease-and-desist orders, mandate reinstatement of discharged employees with full back pay and benefits, and impose significant punitive fines on offending employers.
 - A pattern of such violations by an employer shall trigger a mandatory investigation and may result in the temporary suspension of their business license or, for severe and repeat offenses, the state-assisted conversion of the enterprise into a worker-cooperative, with compensation provided to the former owners at a rate determined by an independent assessor.

### Section 23: Gender Equity, Care, and Freedom from Patriarchy

1. **Systemic Equality Mandate:** The Republic recognizes that patriarchy constitutes a systemic denial of rights. All branches of government shall take affirmative, measurable action to dismantle patriarchal structures in law, economy, and culture.

2. **Care Justice:** Care work, including domestic labor, childcare, and elder care, is recognized as essential social labor. The state shall ensure it is neither uncompensated nor borne disproportionately by any group, through public support, services, and compensation.

3. **Parity in Governance:** All public bodies established under this Constitution shall achieve and maintain gender parity. No branch, assembly, court, or commission shall have less than equal representation of women and gender minorities.

4. **Right to Live Free from Gender-Based Violence:** The state shall guarantee comprehensive protection, prevention, and redress for gender-based violence, including through funded shelters, specialized justice responses, and economic support for survivors.

5. **Reproductive Justice:** Every person has the right to reproductive justice—to have children, not to have children, and to parent in safe and supported conditions. The state shall ensure access to necessary healthcare, education, and social resources to make this right effective.

### Section 24: The Right to Information and Public Accountability

1. **Affirmative Right of Access:**

 - Every person has the fundamental and enforceable right to access, inspect, and obtain copies of all records, documents, communications, and data held by any public body, executive agency, legislative office, or judicial administrative unit of the Republic.
 - This right extends to all information produced, acquired, or maintained in the conduct of public business, regardless of its form, date, or medium.

2. **Duty to Disclose and Proactive Transparency:**

 - All public bodies shall have an affirmative, non-delegable duty to publish information of significant public interest in accessible formats without waiting for specific requests.
 - The Scientific Branch and Citizens' Assembly shall jointly maintain a public index of record categories and disclosure compliance ratings for all agencies.

3. **Limitations and Balancing:**

 - This right may be subject only to narrowly tailored, proportionate restrictions necessary to protect:
  * The identity and safety of whistleblowers, victims, and witnesses.
  * Legitimate and ongoing criminal investigations, where disclosure would materially prejudice the investigation.
  * Genuine and demonstrable national security secrets, certified by the Security Branch and subject to judicial review.
  * The reasonable privacy expectations of natural persons, where disclosure would cause substantial and unwarranted harm and the public interest does not require disclosure.
 - The burden of proving an exemption applies shall rest solely on the public body asserting it.
 - All exemptions shall be construed narrowly in favor of disclosure.

4. **Enforcement and Private Right of Action:**

 - Any person denied access to information in violation of this Section may bring a civil action directly in the appropriate court of the Republic.
 - Such actions shall be granted expedited consideration and shall take precedence over all but the most urgent matters.
 - No standing requirement beyond the denial of access shall be imposed. The plaintiff need not demonstrate personal harm.
 - Sovereign immunity is expressly waived for all claims arising under this Section.

5. **Remedies and Structural Enforcement:**

 - Upon finding a violation, the court shall:
  * Order the immediate disclosure of the withheld information.
  * Award the prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and litigation expenses.
  * Impose escalating daily fines payable to the Public Information Access Fund, to be deducted from the operating budget of the non-compliant agency, continuing until full compliance is achieved.
 - For a knowing, willful, or pattern of violations, the court may also:
  * Order the appointment of an independent special master to supervise compliance.
  * Suspend the authority of the responsible official to make future disclosure determinations.
  * Refer the matter for criminal prosecution under Article II, Section 3.

6. **Legislative and Executive Accountability:**

 - No statute, regulation, or executive order may repeal, diminish, or condition the exercise of this right except through a constitutional amendment.
 - Any public official who knowingly and willfully violates this Section, or who directs or encourages others to do so, shall be subject to the penalties enumerated in Article II, Section 3 and Article XII, Section 1.
 - Failure to comply with a statutory disclosure mandate within the time prescribed by law shall constitute a prima facie violation of this Section, and the burden shall shift to the public body to justify its delay.

7. **Unamendable Status:**

 - This Section is part of the unamendable core of this Constitution. It may not be repealed, amended, or suspended, in whole or in part.

### Section 25: Right to Research Autonomy and Scientific Integrity

1. **Foundational Principle:**

 - The pursuit, creation, and dissemination of knowledge is a fundamental human endeavor essential to human flourishing, societal progress, and the defense of liberty. Scientific inquiry, in particular, requires freedom of thought, inquiry, and expression to fulfill its potential for human benefit.
 - Therefore, the right to conduct research freely, in accordance with the ethical and professional standards of one's discipline, shall be inviolable, subject only to the narrow limitations prescribed in this Section.

2. **Freedom of Inquiry:**

 - Researchers shall have the right to determine the direction of their inquiry, including the right to propose, pursue, and publish research on any topic, without interference, direction, or restriction by the state or any institution acting under its authority, except as provided in this Section.
 - No researcher shall be compelled to pursue or abandon a line of inquiry against their professional judgment, nor shall funding or employment be conditioned on the pursuit of state-determined research priorities, except where such funding is explicitly designated for specific research objectives and voluntarily accepted.

3. **Intellectual Property and Research Outputs:**

 - Researchers shall hold full ownership of the intellectual property resulting from their work, including patents, copyrights, and data rights, subject to:
  * **Institutional Overhead:** Institutions employing researchers may collect a reasonable fee, not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of gross royalties from commercialized inventions, to fund infrastructure and overhead costs directly supporting research.
  * **Collaboration Incentive:** For patents co-authored by researchers from two or more distinct institutions or departments, the institutional fee shall be reduced to seven and one-half percent (7.5%), to encourage cooperative research.
  * **Open Data Default:** All research data funded by public sources shall default to open access within a reasonable period, not to exceed twelve (12) months from collection, to allow for patent filing and initial publication. Researchers may petition for extended embargo upon showing good cause.
 - These rights shall not be waived by contract. Any agreement purporting to waive or limit a researcher's intellectual property rights under this Section shall be void as against public policy.

4. **Publication Sovereignty:**

 - Researchers have a protected right to publish their findings, regardless of whether such findings are favorable or unfavorable to the state, its policies, commercial interests, or any other entity.
 - No prior restraint on publication shall be imposed except:
  * **National Security Exception:** Upon a finding by the Security Branch, confirmed by the Supreme Court through adversarial proceedings, that publication would create a clear, present, and grave danger to national security that cannot be mitigated by less restrictive means. Such delay shall not exceed twelve (12) months and may be renewed only upon a new finding.
  * **Dual-Use Research:** Where research has significant potential for misuse causing catastrophic harm, the Scientific Branch may recommend redactions or delays, subject to the same judicial review and time limits.
  * **No Commercial or Reputational Delay:** Research shall not be delayed to protect commercial interests, institutional reputation, or for any purpose other than those explicitly enumerated.

5. **Laboratory and Research Integrity:**

 - No researcher may be removed from their laboratory, project, or position, nor have their research privileges substantially restricted, except for:
  * Proven gross misconduct, as defined by the relevant professional community and established through a fair hearing.
  * Sustained and documented non-performance over a period of not less than two (2) years, despite reasonable institutional support and opportunity to improve.
  * Criminal conviction that demonstrably affects professional integrity and fitness to conduct research.
 - The burden of proof shall lie with the institution seeking removal or restriction. All such proceedings shall be conducted before a panel composed primarily of the researcher's professional peers, with right to appeal to the Scientific Branch and ultimately to the courts.

6. **Funding Integrity and Untethered Support:**

 - A significant portion of public research funding shall be distributed as untethered grants—funding awarded on the basis of merit and past performance, without predetermined research directions or political priorities.
 - The Scientific Branch shall, in consultation with the relevant professional communities, establish guidelines for the proportion of untethered funding, which shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the total public research budget absent a finding of compelling public necessity, confirmed by the Citizens' Assembly.
 - Peer review panels making funding decisions shall be composed of active researchers in the relevant fields, selected through processes that minimize conflicts of interest and ensure diversity of perspective.

7. **Whistleblower Protection for Researchers:**

 - Researchers who, in good faith, report violations of this Section, scientific misconduct, corruption in research funding, or attempts to suppress or distort research findings shall enjoy the full protections of Article I, Section 20, including:
  * Absolute protection from retaliation by any institution, public or private.
  * The right to triple back-pay and full reinstatement if retaliated against.
  * Criminal penalties for retaliators, including mandatory minimum sentences.
  * Monetary rewards where disclosure leads to recovery of funds or prevention of substantial public harm.

8. **Ethical Boundaries and Self-Governance:**

 - The rights guaranteed in this Section do not diminish the researcher's obligation to conduct research ethically, in accordance with:
  * The principles of informed consent, beneficence, and justice in human subjects research.
  * The 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) in animal research.
  * The standards of professional integrity, including prohibitions on fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism.
  * Dual-use research review conducted by peer panels, with appeal rights.
 - These ethical standards shall be developed and enforced by the scientific community through peer review, institutional review boards, and professional societies, subject to the oversight of the Scientific Branch and the courts. No political authority shall impose ethical restrictions on research that lack a basis in widely accepted scientific or medical ethics.

9. **The Research Integrity Office:**

 - There shall be established, within the Scientific Branch, a Research Integrity Office with authority to:
  * Investigate allegations of research misconduct or violations of this Section.
  * Issue findings and, where appropriate, recommend sanctions to institutions or professional bodies.
  * Maintain a public register of serious misconduct findings, subject to privacy protections for affected individuals.
  * Report annually to the Citizens' Assembly on the state of research integrity.
 - Investigations shall be conducted fairly, with due process for accused researchers, and shall be completed within time limits established by law.

10. **International Research Collaboration:**

 - Researchers retain the right to collaborate with international colleagues, share data and materials across borders, and participate in global scientific endeavors, subject only to:
  * Export control laws consistent with national security, enacted by Congress and certified by the Security Branch as narrowly tailored and necessary.
  * Sanctions and embargoes lawfully imposed by the Political Sphere pursuant to binding international obligations.
  * Ethical standards that are at least as protective as those required by this Constitution.
 - No restriction on international collaboration shall be imposed for the purpose of suppressing scientific findings or insulating the state from criticism.

11. **Limitations and Balancing:**

 - The rights in this Section may be restricted only when necessary to prevent:
  * Imminent, grave, and demonstrable harm to public health or safety.
  * Violations of the ethical standards referenced in Section 8.
  * Clear and present danger to national security, as defined in Section 4.
 - Any restriction shall be the least restrictive means available, shall be subject to prior judicial review where feasible, and shall not discriminate against particular researchers, fields, or findings based on their content or viewpoint.
 - The burden of justifying any restriction shall rest on the party imposing it.

12. **Saving Clause:**

 - Nothing in this Section shall be construed to:
  * Limit the power of institutions to allocate resources among competing research priorities, provided such allocation does not discriminate on the basis of the content or conclusions of research.
  * Require funding for any particular research project or line of inquiry.
  * Impair the rights of research subjects under Article I, Section 6 or other provisions of this Constitution.
  * Protect research that violates the fundamental rights of others, including the rights to privacy, bodily autonomy, and freedom from discrimination.

13. **Enforcement and Private Right of Action:**

 - Any researcher whose rights under this Section are violated may bring a civil action directly in the appropriate court of the Republic.
 - Such actions shall be granted expedited consideration and shall take precedence over all but the most urgent matters.
 - Prevailing plaintiffs shall be entitled to injunctive relief, actual damages, punitive damages for willful violations, and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
 - Sovereign immunity is expressly waived for all claims arising under this Section.

3. **Age of Consent and Protection from Predation:**

 - The general age of consent is 18.
 - Sexual activity between an individual who is under 21 years of age and an individual over the age of 25 is prohibited. For the purpose of this clause, the older partner's age is calculated by their birth date.

2. Chemically induced executions are prohibited, except as specifically provided for in Article I, Section 14.

3. Execution methods must minimize suffering.

### Section 8: Victims' Rights

1. Victims have rights to dignity, protection, and participation in proceedings.

2. Abusive fathers are subject to no-contact orders. Victims are advised to move to a new location for their safety, as moving the aggressor to another location would be pointless if they know where the victim lives.

 - However, if retreating is not possible or safe, the Stand Your Ground clause takes effect, even through lethal force. Non-lethal force is preferred.
 - The Castle Doctrine takes effect in property which the victim owns or is authorized to control. There is no duty to retreat.
 - The Cockpit Doctrine applies to movable property or a semi-enclosed conveyance, such as a vehicle or a trailer, and shall act as an extension of the Castle Doctrine.

6. **Transfer of Liability for Deaths During Aggression:**

 - **Principle of Provocation:** An individual who initiates an unprovoked, violent felony that creates a situation justifying another's use of lethal force in self-defense shall be held legally responsible for any death that occurs as a direct result of that situation.
 - **Inheritance of Charges:** If a person acting in justified self-defense, or a law enforcement officer acting lawfully to stop the aggression, causes the death of an innocent bystander or the aggressor's accomplice, the initiating aggressor shall be charged with and prosecuted for that homicide, as if they had directly caused the death themselves.
 - **Defense of Justification:** This clause shall not apply if the initial aggressor completely and clearly withdraws from the confrontation and communicates that withdrawal to the other party before the lethal force is used.

### Section 10: Sentencing and Acquittal

1. All convicted individuals, whether alive or deceased, have the human right to be exonerated with new evidence.

2. Anyone who knowingly causes the defendant to be imprisoned while they are not guilty shall be subject to a felony charge, which will not be pardonable. Prison time is at the jury's discretion.

3. Any judge or prosecutor who consistently convicts and sentences defendants, or rules against plaintiffs based on legally protected characteristics, is subject to investigation. Proof of discriminatory practices is punishable by life in prison with no possibility of parole.

4. Exoneration is not a pardon.

5. If charges are dismissed, expungement is automatic.

### Section 11: Criminal Conspiracy and Complicity

1. **Principle of Intent:** The Republic recognizes that conspiracy—the deliberate planning and agreement to commit a felony—demonstrates a fixed criminal intent that poses a clear and present danger to the social order. The mental culpability of conspiracy is commensurate with that of the completed felony.

2. **Tier 1: Concrete Conspiracy:** Any person who knowingly agrees with one or more persons to commit a felony, and who commits a concrete overt act in furtherance of that agreement, is guilty of conspiracy.

3. **Sentencing for Conspiracy:** A conviction for conspiracy shall be punishable by a sentence equivalent to that prescribed for the underlying felony. Sentencing judges shall have discretion within the statutory range to consider the nature of the overt act and the specific danger posed by the plot, but shall not sentence below a mandatory minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the maximum penalty for the underlying felony.

4. **Tier 2: Attempted or Completed Felony:** Any person who knowingly attempts to commit a felony, whether the attempt succeeds or fails, shall be prosecuted and punished as if the felony had been completed. Parole eligibility may be restricted for violent felonies.

5. **Principle of Accomplice Liability:** Any person who knowingly aids, abets, counsels, or facilitates an offense described in this section shall be prosecuted and punished as a principal offender.

### Section 12: The Doctrine of Substance Over Form for Anti-Evasion

1. **Principle of Economic Reality:** In the application and enforcement of the laws of the Republic, the substance, economic reality, and actual purpose of arrangements shall prevail over their legal form. This principle shall be known as the Doctrine of Substance Over Form.

2. **Anti-Evasion Mandate:** No person or entity shall be permitted to avoid the intent, application, or consequences of the law through the use of artificial, complex, or opaque structures that have no substantial purpose other than to evade legal obligations, taxes, or regulatory oversight.

3. **Judicial Power to Disregard Legal Form:**

 - Courts and regulatory agencies are hereby empowered and required to disregard the separate legal identities of affiliated entities, or the specific form of transaction, when it is established that the principal purpose was to evade a legal obligation.
 - In such cases, the courts shall have the authority to consolidate the assets and liabilities of affiliated entities, recharacterize transactions according to their economic substance, and impose liability on the controlling parties behind the attempt of evasion.

4. **Burden of Proof:** In any proceeding where the state alleges an arrangement has been made for the principal purpose of evasion, the burden shall shift to the defendant(s) to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the arrangement had a bona fide, substantial purpose independent of tax or regulatory avoidance.

5. **Liability for Aiding Evasion:** Lawyers, accountants, financial advisors, and other professionals who knowingly design, promote, or implement schemes whose principal purpose is the evasion of law shall be subject to prosecution as accomplices, including penalties commensurate with the offense they aided.

### Section 13: Psychological Assault and Violence Against Human Dignity

1. The use of intimate media, whether real or synthesized, for financial gain or "revenge porn" shall be deemed a violent felony due to its psychological impact.

2. Blackmailing a victim, especially a child, is the most serious crime under this section.

3. Offenses and penalties are as follows:

 - The first offense shall include a minimum mandatory sentence of ten years in prison, with ten years of post-sentencing being forbidden to use devices not provided by the state to ensure monitoring.
 - Being caught with a non-government device, or altering software to bypass any monitoring mechanisms of such a device, shall be grounds for five years in prison, and permanent forfeiture of the right to use non-government devices.
 - Being caught using a device in violation of the above shall constitute life in prison.
 - If the offender is a foreigner, they will be wanted for the rest of their lives. Any country that allows extradition will be guaranteed that the offending individual does not face the death penalty until they commit a crime on our soil that warrants such.

### Section 14: Protection from Double Jeopardy and Prosecutorial Oppression

1. **The Right of Finality:** No person shall be subject to a second prosecution or punishment for the same offense after a lawful acquittal or conviction.

2. **The "Same Offense" Defined:** Two offenses are the same for the purposes of this section if they are based on the same physical act or course of conduct, unless each offense requires proof of a distinct and independent element that the other does not, and the elements address substantively different harms to the social order.

3. **The Absolute Bar:** An acquittal by any court of competent jurisdiction is final and irrevocable. The state shall have no right of appeal against a verdict of acquittal.

4. **The Militant Exception - Prosecutorial Misconduct:** If a court finds that a prosecutor has sought a second trial for the same offense in bad faith, or with the intent to harass or oppress the defendant after an acquittal, the following shall apply:

 - The prosecutor shall be immediately disbarred.
 - The prosecutor shall be charged with the felony of "Attempted Deprivation of Constitutional Rights," punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence equivalent to the maximum sentence for the offense they attempted to re-prosecute.
 - The defendant shall be entitled to civil damages from the prosecutor's personal assets, equivalent to ten times the cost of their legal defense for both trials.

5. **The Exception - Collateral Consequences:** This section does not prohibit civil proceedings, conducted by the Worker's Branch or other relevant body, to secure restitution for victims, or to seek the equitable disgorgement of illicit profits, provided such proceedings are not punitive in nature and do not threaten the liberty of the person.

### Section 15: Remedial Powers for Weaponized Defamation

1. **Finding of Weaponized Defamation:** In any case where a court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a party has engaged in weaponized defamation—defined as the deliberate, malicious, and viral distortion of factual statements to incite hatred or violence against a person or group—the court may, in addition to standard damages, issue a Corrective Equity Order.

2. **The Corrective Equity Order:** This order is designed not to punish, but to restore the factual record and deprive the defamation of its corrosive power. The order must be the least restrictive means to achieve this goal and is subject to the following absolute constraints:

 - It shall NEVER involve compelled speech. No individual or entity shall be forced to utter, create, or broadcast any message.
 - It shall NEVER violate bodily autonomy as defined in Article I, Section 6.
 - It shall NEVER impose a prior restraint on future speech.

3. **Authorized Remedies:** The court's order may compel one or more of the following actions, tailored to the scale and nature of the defamation:

 - **Mandatory Silence:** The court may order the defaming party to refrain from speaking or publishing on the specific, falsified topic for a period not to exceed 90 days. This is a "cooling off" period to stop the viral lie from being repeatedly amplified.
 - **Asset Seizure for Corrective Advertising:** The court may order the seizure of financial assets from the defaming party equivalent to 300% of the quantified damages. These seized funds are not a fine; they are placed in a state-managed fund. The defamed party, or a designated public-interest entity, may use these funds exclusively to purchase airtime, digital ads, or print space on any platform of their choice to present their own message and correct the record. The defamer has no control over this message.
 - **Platform Access Surrender:** In cases of viral digital defamation, the court may order the defaming party to surrender their access to their primary platform of offense for a period of 30-90 days. The account would be placed in a protected, inactive state, preventing posting but leaving the original defamatory content visible as a matter of public record.

4. **Judicial Discretion and Appeal:** The presiding judge must provide a written justification for the chosen remedy, explaining why it is the least restrictive means to correct the harm. All Corrective Equity Orders are subject to immediate, expedited appeal to the Supreme Court.

### Section 16: Prohibition on Polygraph Evidence

1. **Findings of Fact:** The Republic finds that psychophysiological deception detection devices, commonly known as "lie detectors" or polygraphs, measure physiological responses that are not unique to deception. These responses can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including anxiety, fear, confusion, physiological conditions, and cultural background. The scientific consensus holds that there is no physiological response or pattern of responses that is specific to deception, rendering such evidence fundamentally unreliable.

2. **Prohibition on Use in Legal Proceedings:**

 - The results of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a polygraph examiner, or any reference to an individual's willingness or refusal to take a polygraph test shall be inadmissible as evidence in any court, administrative hearing, or other legal proceeding within the Republic.
 - This prohibition applies to all parties, including the prosecution, defense, and civil litigants.

3. **Prohibition on Use by Law Enforcement:**

 - No law enforcement agency, intelligence service, or any other organ of the state shall require, request, or suggest that a witness, suspect, or victim submit to a polygraph examination as a condition of investigation or cooperation.

### Section 17: Posthumous Accountability and Victim Restitution

1. **Principle of Restitution from Grandfathered Assets:** An aggressor's initiation of an unprovoked violent felony creates a debt to their victims. This debt survives the aggressor's death and shall be satisfied exclusively from the assets of their grandfathered private estate, as defined in Article III.

2. **The Restitution Order:**

 - Upon a judicial finding by clear and convincing evidence that a deceased individual initiated the violent felony that led to their death by justified defensive force, the court shall issue a Restitution Order.
 - This order is a claim solely against the aggressor's grandfathered private estate and covers:
  * All medical, psychological, and psychiatric costs for the defender and innocent bystanders.
  * Full compensation for lost wages and replacement value of all damaged personal property.
 - **State-Assisted Process:** All legal proceedings under this section shall be conducted at state expense. No victim shall bear any legal costs.

3. **Satisfaction of the Order from the Estate:**

 - The Restitution Order shall be satisfied from the liquidatable assets of the grandfathered estate.
 - The following are **absolutely exempt** and cannot be used to satisfy the order:
  * The family's use-rights to the property.
  * Life insurance proceeds paid directly to named beneficiaries.
  * Essential household goods and tools of trade for dependents.

4. **Application of the Doctrine of Substance Over Form:**

 - The courts shall apply Article II, Section 12 to disregard any legal arrangement made by the aggressor, either before or after the violent act, whose principal purpose was to shield assets from this restitution process.
 - The burden shall shift to the estate to prove by clear and convincing evidence that any contested asset transfer was made for a bona fide purpose independent of evading this section.

5. **Final Recourse - The Public Restitution Fund:**

 - If the liquidatable assets of the grandfathered estate are insufficient to cover the full Restitution Order, the remaining balance shall be paid immediately to the victims from the Public Restitution Fund.

### Section 18: Right to Compensation for Property Destruction During State Operations

1. **The Principle of State Responsibility:** The state bears absolute financial responsibility for any and all damage to property resulting from the execution of its authority, including but not limited to the service of search warrants, arrest warrants, or other court orders.

2. **Tier 1: Compensation for Private Homeowners:**

 - If a lawfully owned private residence is damaged or destroyed during the execution of a state operation, the owner shall be entitled to full and immediate compensation, regardless of the operation's outcome.
 - **Standard for Compensation:** Compensation shall be based on the full replacement cost of the dwelling and the fair market value of all destroyed personal property within. The burden of proving the value of lost property shall be on the state, which must err in favor of the homeowner in any case of ambiguity.
 - **Expedited Process:** A claim under this section shall be processed within 90 days. If the state fails to issue payment within this period, the compensation shall automatically accrue interest at a rate of 10% per month.

3. **Tier 2: Redress for Tenants of Public or Private Housing:**

 - If a residence held by the Public Housing Trust or a grandfathered private landlord is damaged or destroyed during a state operation, the tenant(s) residing therein shall have a direct cause of action against the state.
 - **Guaranteed Re-housing:** The state shall have an immediate, non-delegable duty to provide the tenant with equivalent alternative housing through the Public Housing Trust at no cost.
 - **Right to Sue for Damages:** In addition to re-housing, the tenant shall be entitled to sue the state for significant damages, including but not limited to:
  * Compensation for all destroyed personal property.
  * Compensation for emotional distress, dislocation, and violation of domestic privacy.
  * Any additional costs incurred as a result of the displacement.

4. **Source of Funds:** All compensation and damages paid under this section shall be drawn from the budget of the law enforcement agency responsible for the operation. Under no circumstances shall funds be appropriated from the Public Housing Trust or public education budgets.

5. **Personal Liability for Gross Negligence:** If a court finds that the property destruction resulted from gross negligence, reckless disregard for procedure, or intentional misconduct by an officer or commander, that individual shall be personally liable for a portion of the damages and subject to professional discipline, including dismissal and decertification.

4. The prohibition on "software locks" that prevent repair: The circumvention of technological protection measures shall not be considered a violation of law when the purpose is diagnosis, maintenance, or repair of a lawfully owned product.

5. These obligations shall apply to products sold within the Republic, and Congress shall have the power to enact laws defining specific categories, timelines, and enforcement mechanisms to uphold this right.

 - Upon harvest, borrowers shall return the principal amount of seed, plus a modest surplus to ensure the trust's growth and vitality.

### Section 11: The Phased Transition to Universal Healthcare

1. **Principle:** Healthcare is a public good, not a commodity. The state shall establish a National Health Service (NHS) to provide comprehensive, publicly funded care, displacing for-profit insurance through superior access, quality, and equity.

2. **Establishment of the National Health Service (NHS):**

 - A National Health Service (NHS) shall be established within two years of ratification.
 - The NHS shall be funded through progressive taxation and operate as a publicly owned, non-profit, single-payer system.

  * Preventive, primary, and emergency care.
  * Chronic and mental health care.
  * Essential medications and pediatric care.

 - As NHS coverage expands each phase, private insurers must notify policyholders of reduced scope and adjust premiums accordingly.
 - By the end of Phase 3, private health insurance for medically necessary care is rendered redundant.

6. **Sunset Clause for Duplicate Coverage:**

 - Upon full implementation of Phase 3, private insurers are prohibited from offering duplicate coverage for any service comprehensively covered by the NHS.
 - This prohibition takes effect ten (10) years after ratification, aligning with the completion of NHS rollout.
 - Insurers may continue to offer supplemental policies for:
  * Elective aesthetic procedures.
  * Non-covered amenities.
  * Travel health insurance until obsolete.
  * Expedited access within NHS guidelines, provided it does not create a two-tier system that compromises NHS equity.

1. Legislative Branch
2. Executive Branch
3. Judicial Branch
4. Citizen Branch
5. Worker's Branch (Proletariat Union)
6. Historian Branch
7. Scientific Branch

### Section 2: Legislative Branch

1. Unicameral Congress with 5-year terms.

2. Members limited to four terms.

3. Members of Congress shall be elected through single-winner ranked-choice voting from multi-member districts.

### Section 3: Executive Branch

1. President with 5-year terms.

2. Limited to two terms.

3. The President shall be elected through nationwide ranked-choice voting.

### Section 4: Judicial Branch

1. Supreme Court Justices shall serve four terms, each with nine years.

2. The term length is established to ensure alignment with the electorate. Within one judicial term, the entire body of eligible voters is replenished, thereby maintaining the judiciary's connection to the contemporary will of the people.

3. Justices are subject to the term limits outlined in Section 9 of this Article.

### Section 5: Citizen Branch

1. **Composition:** The Citizen Branch shall be composed of Citizens' Assemblies in each state. Each state's Assembly shall consist of 1,000 members, selected by annual sortition from the state's roster of eligible citizens. This large number is deliberate: it enables the Assembly to dispatch multiple investigative committees simultaneously, to travel throughout the state conducting hearings, to maintain continuous oversight of state agencies, and to ensure that no small faction can dominate the body's work.

2. **Powers:** Each state's Citizens' Assembly shall have the power to:

 - Investigate the operations of the state government and any federal entities within their state.
 - Initiate impeachment by 60% vote.
 - Veto regulations and administrative rules by 60% vote.
 - Dispatch committees to any location within the state to conduct hearings, inspect facilities, and gather evidence.
 - Issue subpoenas and compel testimony in furtherance of investigations.

### Section 6: The Historian Branch

1. The Historian Branch shall be a 500-member Congress of History. Its members shall be selected by annual sortition from the national roster of all certified historians. The size of this body enables it to conduct multiple historical inquiries simultaneously, to dispatch research teams to archives and sites across the Republic, and to maintain specialized committees on different historical periods and regions.

2. Just as with the Citizen Branch, they have the same powers. But with vast knowledge of history, their job is to ensure corrupt officials are held accountable through rigorous historical investigation.

### Section 7: The Worker's Branch (Proletariat Union)

1. **Composition:** The Worker's Branch shall be a 500-member Congress of Labor. Its members shall be selected by annual sortition from the national roster of all working and retired citizens. This number ensures that the Branch can maintain standing committees on different industries, dispatch investigative teams to workplaces across the country, and respond rapidly to labor violations wherever they occur.

2. **Eligibility:** Any citizen aged 18 or older who is currently employed, self-employed, unemployed, or retired after a minimum of 10 years of workforce participation is eligible for selection.

3. **Civic Duty & Support:** Service is a civic duty. Members shall receive a generous stipend and necessary resources to serve effectively, including travel and investigative budgets. Their previous jobs will be protected upon their return.

4. **Mandate:** Its primary mandate is to protect the dignity, security, and economic rights of all people who work. It shall act as a permanent counterbalance to capital concentration and corporate power.

5. **Powers:** The Worker's Branch shall have the power to:

 - **Legislate Labor Standards:** Enact binding codes establishing a national minimum wage, maximum working hours, and mandatory paid leave. These codes shall have the force of law across the Republic.
 - **Define Full-Time Employment:** Legally define full-time employment as any work schedule totaling 21 hours per week or more. All rights, benefits, and protections afforded to full-time workers shall be granted at this threshold.
 - **Mandate Breaks:** Legislate that all employers must provide a minimum of one hour of unpaid break time for every eight hours of work. Refusal of an employer to permit a break, or coercion making a break impractical, shall be treated as an offer of overtime, requiring overtime compensation for the entire period the break was denied.
 - **Veto Power:** Veto, by a 60% majority, any legislation passed by the Legislative Congress that directly impacts labor rights, wage standards, workplace safety, or social welfare programs.
 - **Investigate and Subpoena:** Investigate any business or corporation for labor rights violations and issue subpoenas for testimony and documents. The Branch may conduct hearings anywhere in the Republic.
 - **Initiate Legislation:** Propose legislation on economic and labor matters directly to the Legislative Congress for a vote.

### Section 8: Scientific Branch

1. **Establishment and Purpose:** The Scientific Branch is hereby established to ensure that the laws and long-term policies of the Republic are informed by the best available scientific evidence, technological understanding, and rational foresight. Its purpose is to safeguard the long-term health, security, and prosperity of the people and the environment from the distortions of short-term political cycles, partisan interests, and corporate influence.

2. **The Electorate: The National Scientific Assembly:**

 - The members of the Scientific Branch shall be elected by a body known as the National Scientific Assembly.
 - Membership in the National Scientific Assembly is automatic and mandatory for all citizens who hold an advanced degree (Master's or higher) from an accredited institution in a scientific, technological, engineering, mathematical, medical, or relevant social science field, and who are certified as actively practicing in their field or are retired after a minimum of 10 years of practice.
 - The National Scientific Assembly shall maintain its own roster and shall be facilitated by an independent, non-partisan electoral commission.

3. **Composition and Election of the Governing Council:**

 - The governing body of the branch shall be a Council of Scientific Governors.
 - The Council shall consist of 101 members.
 - **Election by Peer:** Every two years, one-fifth of the Council (20 or 21 seats) shall be elected by the National Scientific Assembly through a secure ranked-choice voting system.
 - **Term of Office:** Elected members shall serve a single, non-renewable term of ten years.
 - **Civic Duty:** Service is an optional civic duty. Members shall receive a stipend and necessary resources. Their previous employment will be protected upon their return.

4. **Mandate and Powers: The Scientific Branch shall have the following powers and responsibilities:**

 - **Legislative Impact Assessment:**
  * To issue public Scientific Impact Statements on any proposed legislation. These statements will assess the bill's basis in evidence and its projected effects on public health, the environment, and technological stability.
  * The Legislative Congress must receive and publicly table these statements for a period of 30 days before a final vote.
 - **Binding Veto on Anti-Empirical Legislation:**
  * By a vote of 60% of its members, the Council may issue a Veto of Scientific Necessity on any legislation passed by the Legislative Congress that is demonstrably and fundamentally contradicted by an overwhelming, reproducible scientific consensus.
  * The Legislative Congress may override this veto only with a three-fourths (¾) supermajority vote.
 - **Long-Term Risk Reporting:** To produce and publish an annual Report on Existential and Long-Term Risks. This report will be presented directly to the Citizens' Assembly, the Worker's Branch, and the public.
 - **Limitations:**
  * The Scientific Branch shall have no power to initiate taxation or appropriate funds.
  * Its authority does not extend into the exclusive jurisdiction of the Surgeon Court on matters of settled medical law.

5. **Transparency and Ethical Safeguards:**

 - All deliberations and votes of the Council shall be a matter of public record.
 - Members are subject to strict conflict-of-interest rules, including a lifetime ban on lobbying the government after their term.

### Section 9: Term Limits

1. No candidate, whether state or federal, shall run for a new term after age 65.

2. If the candidate is elected before age 65, they may complete their current term.

### Section 10: Limitation on Repeated Sortition Service

1. **Preamble and Rationale:** To preserve the integrity of sortition as a true reflection of the common citizen, to prevent the consolidation of experiential advantage, and to distribute the burden and privilege of civic service as widely as possible among the populace, the probability of a citizen being selected for service shall diminish with each prior term of service.

2. **The Weighted Sortition:**

 - A secure, automated, and publicly auditable National Civic Service Registry shall be maintained by the National Electoral Commission.
 - This registry shall track all citizens and assign them a service weight based on their prior service:
  * **Weight 1 (Base Weight):** Citizens with zero prior terms of service.
  * **Weight 0.5 (Half Weight):** Citizens with one prior term of service.
  * **Weight 0.25 (Quarter Weight):** Citizens with two prior terms of service.
  * **Weight 0 (Zero Weight):** Citizens with three or more prior terms of service shall be permanently ineligible for further sortition.

3. **The Sortition Process:**

 - The annual sortition for the Citizens', Worker's, and Historian's Branches shall be conducted by randomly selecting names from the national roster, with each citizen's chance of selection being proportional to their assigned service weight.
 - This system ensures that while a novice citizen is most likely to be chosen, a citizen with valuable prior experience remains in the pool, albeit with a significantly reduced chance of selection.

4. **Scope and Application:**

 - This diminishing probability applies across all sortition-based branches. A term served in the Citizens' Assembly will reduce a citizen's weight for future sortition to the Worker's Branch and Historian Branch, and vice versa.
 - This limitation applies only to sortition-based federal branches. It does not affect a citizen's right to vote, run for elected office, serve in appointed roles, or participate in local-level sortition bodies.

5. **Transparency and Verification:**

 - The algorithm and source code for the weighted sortition process shall be public and open to audit.
 - A citizen may formally appeal their listed service count only on the grounds of mistaken identity.

### Section 11: Eligibility and Selection Process for Sortition Branches

1. **Eligible Population:** All citizens who meet the following criteria shall be eligible for selection to any sortition-based branch established under this Article:

 - Successful completion of state-certified civic education as required under Article XV, Section 3, Clause 4.
 - No conviction for a violent felony as defined in Article II.
 - Not currently holding elected federal office.
 - Not an immediate family member of a current sortition branch member serving in any federal sortition body. For purposes of this clause, "immediate family" shall be defined as spouse, parent, sibling, or child.

2. **Disqualifications (Conflict of Interest):** An otherwise eligible citizen shall be disqualified from selection or, if selected, shall be ineligible to serve if:

 - They are currently employed by, or serve as a consultant, board member, or contractor for, any entity under active investigation by the branch to which they have been selected.
 - They own more than five percent (5%) of the equity or voting shares of any for-profit corporation, if selected for the Worker's Branch.
 - Their spouse or minor child currently holds elected federal office.
 - A majority vote of the seated members of the relevant branch determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that service would create an obvious and substantial conflict of interest incompatible with the duties of the branch. Such determination shall be subject to immediate judicial review.

3. **Selection Algorithm:**

 - The selection of members for all sortition-based branches shall be conducted using a cryptographically secure random selection algorithm.
 - The full source code of the selection algorithm shall be publicly disclosed and open to independent audit no fewer than ninety (90) days prior to each annual selection.
 - The selection event shall be witnessed in real time by designated representatives of each sortition-based branch, the National Electoral Commission, and the Scientific Branch.
 - A complete, unredacted audit trail of the selection process, sufficient to verify the randomness and integrity of the outcome, shall be published within twenty-four (24) hours of the selection's conclusion.

4. **Prevention of Pre-Selection Manipulation:**

 - Any person or entity that knowingly offers, pays, or promises any compensation, benefit, or thing of value to an eligible citizen with the intent to influence their future conduct as a potential sortition member, where such compensation is contingent upon or conditioned on their selection or service, shall be guilty of a felony punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty (20) years imprisonment.
 - This prohibition expressly includes corporate or institutional "bonuses," "retention payments," or other financial incentives offered in anticipation of selection.
 - Any eligible citizen who knowingly accepts such compensation shall be permanently disqualified from all future sortition service.

5. **Inability to Serve Exemptions:** A citizen selected for service may decline appointment only upon demonstration, by clear and convincing evidence, of one or more of the following grounds:

 - **Medical incapacity:** Certified by two licensed physicians, independent of one another, attesting to a physical or mental condition that renders the citizen unable to perform the duties of the office.
 - **Sole caregiver status:** Verified by sworn affidavit and supporting documentation that the citizen is the sole or primary caregiver for a minor child, elderly parent, or dependent with a disability, and that no alternative care arrangement is reasonably available.
 - **Severe economic hardship:** Demonstrated household income below the federal poverty line for a family of equivalent size, such that service would impose extreme and irremediable deprivation.
 - Upon grant of an exemption, a replacement shall be selected from the same demographic and geographic pool using the same weighted sortition process.

6. **Compensation and Protection:** Citizens serving in any sortition-based branch shall receive the following guarantees:

 - **Salary:** A stipend equal to the median household income of the Republic, adjusted annually, paid throughout the term of service.
 - **Healthcare:** Comprehensive coverage under the National Health Service for the duration of the term and for one (1) full year following the conclusion of service.
 - **Job protection:** Any public or private employer shall be required to hold the citizen's position or provide equivalent employment at equal or greater compensation upon the conclusion of their service. Retaliation against an employee for service in a sortition branch shall be subject to the penalties enumerated in Article I, Section 20.
 - **Housing:** If service requires relocation more than fifty (50) kilometers from the citizen's primary residence, the state shall provide adequate, secure housing at no cost for the duration of the term.
 - **Security:** Upon a finding of credible threat to the safety of the citizen or their immediate family, the state shall provide appropriate personal protection and security measures for the duration of the threat.
 - **Travel and Investigation Budgets:** Each sortition branch shall receive adequate funding to enable its members to travel, conduct hearings, and perform investigations throughout the Republic. The size of these branches is designed to facilitate the dispatch of multiple investigative committees simultaneously.

3. **The Inquest Process:** The Historian Court shall conduct public proceedings, acting as historical investigators. They will compile a dossier of evidence, hear from experts, and allow the subject of the inquest to present their own evidence. Their task is not to judge the person, but to establish the factual record of their affiliations, statements, and ideological commitments.

4. **The Binding Finding:** The Historian Court will issue a Binding Finding of Fact to the Supreme Court. This finding is limited to a "Yes" or "No" answer to the question posed in Clause 2. The Historian Court's Finding of Fact is final and cannot be appealed on its merits.

2. **Second Offense:** 14-day protective detainment with judicial review.

3. **Third Offense:** Detainment for a period not to exceed 90 days, subject to immediate and bi-weekly judicial review to ensure the detention remains necessary and proportionate to the public health threat.

5. **Fifth and Final Offense:** A fifth violation shall be punishable by life imprisonment, with eligibility for parole determined by a parole board after a minimum of 25 years served.

6. **Full-Cost Liability for Reckless Endangerment:**

 - **Guarantee of Care:** Any individual convicted of a fourth or subsequent offense shall receive the full and complete standard of medical care for any illness related to the disease subject to the emergency. Healthcare providers are obligated to provide treatment identical in quality and scope to that provided to any other citizen.
 - **Shift of Financial Responsibility:** Notwithstanding the guarantee of care, the state's subsidy for such care is revoked for the convicted individual. The individual shall be solely and fully financially liable for 100% of the costs associated with their medical treatment.

## ARTICLE VII: CONSTITUTIONAL SUPREMACY

### Section 1: Supreme Law

1. This Constitution voids conflicting laws.

2. If a rights violation is in conflict with Articles I, II, V, VII and XVI is in the books of state jurisdictions, they are not only struck down and void, but also must be removed.

### Section 2: Amendment Process

1. 2/3 Congressional approval + majority referendum.

## ARTICLE VIII: THE SURGEON COURT

### Section 1: Establishment and Jurisdictional Hierarchy

1. The Surgeon Court is hereby established as the final and exclusive court of appeal for all matters of medical fact, medical methodology, clinical efficacy, and public health science.

2. Its jurisdiction includes, but is not limited to:

 - The safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and treatment protocols.
 - The definition of standard of care for medical conditions.
 - The scientific basis for public health measures.
 - Questions of medical necessity and the appropriate application of specific medical interventions, including abortion and end-of-life care.

3. The Supreme Court remains the court of final appeal for all matters of constitutional law, fundamental rights, statutory interpretation, and all non-medical scientific and technical matters.

4. The Supreme Court is expressly and absolutely forbidden from re-litigating or overturning a finding of medical fact or technical medical standard made by the Surgeon Court. The Surgeon Court's findings on these matters are final and binding on all other branches of government, including the Supreme Court.

5. All justices in this court are elected by certified medical doctors.

### Section 2: The "Settled Medical Law" Doctrine

1. Once the Surgeon Court establishes a medical fact, this finding becomes a principle of Settled Medical Law.

2. Settled Medical Law is permanent. It cannot be ignored or overturned by any branch of government, including a future Surgeon Court.

3. The only exception is if new, overwhelming, and replicable medical evidence emerges that is accepted by the global medical community. A future Surgeon Court may then issue a new ruling that updates the scientific understanding, but it does not overturn the old one. The ruling is simply superseded by the new one.

4. **The Constitutional Limitation:**

 - No finding of Settled Medical Law shall be interpreted or applied by any branch of government to justify a mandate prohibited under Article I, Section 6.
 - The authority of the Surgeon Court is to establish medical fact for the purposes of informing public policy, guiding medical practice, and as evidence in legal proceedings. Its findings do not, in and of themselves, create a legal compulsion that overrides the fundamental right to Bodily Autonomy.

### Section 3: The Medical Referral Process

1. In any case before it, the Supreme Court shall identify any specific questions of medical fact that are necessary to resolve the constitutional dispute.

2. The Supreme Court shall issue a formal referral of those questions to the Surgeon Court for a binding finding.

3. The Surgeon Court shall conduct proceedings to establish the relevant medical facts and return a Binding Medical Finding to the Supreme Court.

4. The Supreme Court has no authority to question and shall render its judgment on the constitutional questions based upon it.

### Section 4: Resolution of Jurisdictional Disputes

1. A standing Medical Jurisdiction Panel shall be established to resolve disputes over whether a question posed by the Supreme Court is one of pure medical fact (Surgeon Court) or non-medical fact/constitutional law (Supreme Court).

2. The Panel shall be composed of five members: two appointed by the Surgeon Court, two appointed by the Supreme Court, and a fifth chairperson who is a former Surgeon General or equivalent, voted for by certified medical doctors.

3. The Panel's sole task is to classify the referred question. Its decision, requiring a simple majority, is final.

---

## ARTICLE IX: THE HISTORIAN COURT

The Historian Court's job is to ensure the integrity of historical fact. Its powers and limitations are the same as the Surgeon Court, and it is elected by certified historians.

### Section 1: Mandate and Jurisdictional Limit

1. The Historian Court is established as a tribunal of fact. Its sole mandate is to investigate and make findings on questions of historical and factual record referred to it by the Supreme Court pursuant to Article V, Section 6.

2. The Court's power of inquiry is strictly and exclusively limited to determining facts relevant to a potential violation of Article I, Section 5. It shall have no power to conduct open-ended inquiries or to define new categories of ineligibility.

### Section 2: The Article I Framework for Findings

1. In any proceeding before it, the Historian Court's central question must be framed with explicit reference to the rights defined in Article I. The question shall be:

"Does the preponderance of the evidence—including public speeches, writings, associations, and actions—demonstrate that the individual in question adheres to an ideology or organization that explicitly advocates for the denial of one or more of the fundamental rights enumerated in Article I of this Constitution to any person or group based on a characteristic protected under Article I, Section 1?"

2. A "Finding of Fact" issued by the Court must specify:

 - The specific clause(s) of Article I that the individual's ideology threatens.
 - The specific group(s) or person(s) targeted for the denial of rights.
 - The documented evidence that forms the basis of the finding.

### Section 3: Composition and Ethical Safeguards

1. The Court shall be composed of historians and legal scholars selected for their expertise in political history, ideology, and constitutional law. Justices shall be elected by a National Historical Assembly, constituted of all certified historians, using the peer-election model defined in Article IV, Section 8.

2. Members of the Court are bound by a strict code of professional conduct. They must act as impartial investigators, not as advocates. Any finding must be based solely on the verifiable, public record.

3. Deliberations and the evidential record of the Court shall be a matter of public record, ensuring total transparency in its fact-finding process.

### Section 4: The Binding Finding and its Consequence

1. The Court's Finding of Fact is binding on the Supreme Court for the purpose of issuing a decree of Permanent Disqualification from Public Office under Article V, Section 6.

2. A finding may only be "Yes" or "No" to the question posed in Section 2.1. It shall contain no recommended punishment or political commentary.

3. A "Yes" finding demonstrates that the individual poses a clear and present danger to the constitutional order by seeking to use state power to dismantle its foundational rights. A "No" finding confirms that the individual's record, however controversial, does not meet this high and specific bar.

## ARTICLE X: TRANSITION JUSTICE AND SAFEGUARDS

### Section 1: Protection During Reform

1. It is a felony to threaten, intimidate, or retaliate against any tenant, public official, or employee of the Public Housing Trust for actions taken in accordance with this Constitution, particularly the provisions of Article III.

### Section 2: Penalties for Retaliatory Violence

1. Any person who engages in violence or destruction of property in retaliation for, or to obstruct, the implementation of land stewardship or housing reforms shall, upon conviction:

 - Automatically and permanently forfeit all property rights and use-rights to every property they own or control. All such properties shall revert to the Public Housing Trust without compensation.
 - Face criminal prosecution for the violent acts, with penalties from a minimum of ten (10) years to life imprisonment.

### Section 3: Penalties for Non-Violent Retaliation

1. Any grandfathered landlord or realtor found guilty of non-violent retaliation (e.g., fraudulent paperwork, economic harassment) shall immediately lose their grandfathered status. All their non-primary-residence properties shall revert to the Public Housing Trust.

### Section 4: Diminished Defense for Phased-Out Professions

1. In any criminal proceeding against an individual for acts committed in the course of operating a business or practice that is being phased out or prohibited under this Constitution, the fact that the act was committed for commercial gain shall not be considered a mitigating factor.

2. Conversely, such commercial motivation shall be considered an aggravating factor, as it demonstrates a deliberate choice to prioritize personal profit over compliance with the constitutional order and the public good. This aggravation of penalties shall apply to crimes including fraud, intimidation, harassment, destruction of property, and violence.

---

## ARTICLE XI: NATIONAL SECURITY

### Section 1: Digital Integrity of Government and Financial Devices

1. The installation of foreign software, unless fully open source to be verifiable, is forbidden on all state/provincial and federal devices.

2. Every server is to utilize a fork of OpenBSD or better. By better, this Article means faster for the same security. It does not need any graphical applications.

3. Desktop computers and government issued mobile phones are to use a fork of FreeBSD. Prioritize the Wayland protocol.

4. An agency that deals with software security shall come together and write an anti-virus, firewall, and a software sandbox written in SPARK. This suite of software shall be open source for civilian use. All network drivers are to be facilitated for SPARK programming. The GUI for any SPARK programs must utilize ADA if needed.

5. In the meantime, that agency should conduct a team of developers to explore the Zig programming language for baremetal programming, with anything non-baremetal handled by Rust programmers. Prioritize a framekernel build for desktop security, and conduct audits on a microkernel the same way as OpenBSD. For auditing purposes and maximum security, facilitate rewriting Rust-written components in SPARK for greater assurance in the microkernel operating system.

6. Utilize the RISC-V architecture once it is stabilized. Given its open nature, apply encryption and audit other vulnerabilities.

---

## ARTICLE XII: ACCOUNTABILITY OF AUTHORITY FIGURES

### Section 1: Penalties for Corruption

1. All elected officials are subject to life in prison for corruption and for violating constitutional rights.

### Section 2: Limitation on Pardons

1. There is no possibility of pardons for the offenses in Section 1. Only exoneration based on new evidence is valid.

### Section 3: The Anti-Corruption "Poisoned Chalice" Provision

1. **Legal Acceptance as Enforcement Action:** A public official shall incur no criminal liability for retaining an item of value offered as a bribe, provided the official's actions are conducted in strict compliance with the authorized procedures stipulated in Clause 2 of this Section. In such cases, the act of retention is classified as a lawful component of an anti-corruption enforcement action.

2. **Mandatory Protocol for Officials:** Upon being offered a bribe, a public official is legally obligated to adhere to the following procedure:

 - **Covert Acceptance & Immediate Notification:** The official's primary duty is to secure the evidence and their own safety. They may, without declaring their intent to the briber, take possession of the item and conclude the interaction in a manner that does not raise suspicion.
 - **Mandatory Secure Alert:** Immediately upon the briber's departure, and in no case longer than 48 hours thereafter, the official must activate a secure, silent alarm or use a pre-authorized digital alert system to a designated independent anti-corruption authority. This alert must be automated and signal that a "Poisoned Chalice" procedure has been initiated.
 - **Formal Declaration & Recording:** Upon activation, the official is required to make a formal, time-stamped audio or video recording. This recording shall serve as the "Declarative Acceptance," stating the official's name, the date and time, a description of the briber, and a statement that the item is being secured as evidence under Article XII, Section 3. This recording is transmitted automatically to the anti-corruption authority.
 - **Full Cooperation:** The official must then provide complete and truthful cooperation in the subsequent investigation, including aiding in the swift apprehension of the briber based on the evidence and their testimony.

3. **Criminal Liability of the Briber and Asset Forfeiture:** The act of offering or conferring a bribe constitutes a felony. Upon the official's full compliance with Clause 2, the item of value is immediately forfeited by the briber.

 - **Valuation and Escrow:** The asset shall be promptly appraised by a state-appointed authority. Its fair market value shall be calculated, and the sum shall be transferred to the official. In accordance with Article XII, Section 4, this sum shall be placed into the official's state-managed escrow account, to be accessed only upon their lawful departure from office.
 - **Disposition of Physical Asset:** The physical asset itself shall be sold at public auction or converted to state use. The proceeds from such sale shall be deposited into the Public Housing Trust.

4. **Penalties for Bribery:** Conviction for offering a bribe shall carry a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty (20) years imprisonment, without eligibility for parole. The fact that the briber also suffered the additional penalty of asset forfeiture to the official shall not be considered mitigation during sentencing.

5. **Penalty for Official Misconduct:** Any public official who accepts a bribe and willfully fails to comply with the mandatory protocol in Clause 2 shall be prosecuted for corruption under Article XII, Section 1, subject to life imprisonment or death. As a tighter measure, chemically induced executions will be permitted for this specific scenario due to their unpredictable nature, notwithstanding Article II, Section 7.

### Section 4: Elimination of Financial Incentive for Public Service

1. **Principle:** To eliminate financial motivation for corruption and ensure that public service is driven by duty and not personal gain, the financial compensation for all elected officials shall be structured as follows.

2. **In-Office Support System:**

 - **Accommodation and Sustenance:** The state shall provide all elected officials and their immediate families with secure, high-quality accommodation and up to three nutritious meals per day, available without charge at designated facilities throughout the Republic for the duration of their term.
 - **Official Expenses:** All reasonable costs associated with the execution of their official duties, including travel, security, and communications, shall be borne by the state.

3. **Deferred Compensation Model:**

 - **Escrow of Earnings:** One hundred percent of an elected official's monetary salary and any other state-provided monetary allowances shall be placed into a secure, state-managed escrow account. The official shall have no access to these funds during their term in office.
 - **Release of Funds:** The entire deferred compensation, with accrued interest, shall be released to the official in a lump sum upon their lawful departure from office, provided they have not been impeached and convicted for corruption or a related offense.
 - **Forfeiture for Corruption:** Any official impeached and convicted for corruption, bribery, or embezzlement shall permanently forfeit their entire escrowed earnings to the Public Housing Trust.

4. **Purpose and Intent:** This system is designed to ensure that individuals seeking public office are motivated by a commitment to public welfare, not financial enrichment. By separating the official from direct monetary gain during their service, the state removes a primary vector for corruption and reinforces the principle that public office is a public trust.

### Section 5: The Crime of Political Subversion by Detention

1. **The Offense:** It is a supreme offense against the state, punishable by death, for any public official to knowingly, and with malicious intent to subvert the democratic process, order the arrest or detention of a political official for the sole purpose of terminating a lawful parliamentary tactic.

2. **Definition of Lawful Tactic:** For the purpose of this section, "lawful parliamentary tactic" is strictly defined as:

 - The denial of a quorum.
 - The use of a filibuster or other recognized delaying procedure.
 - A vote against government business.
 - It shall not include incitement to violence, sedition, or any other criminal act.

3. **Standard of Proof:** Conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of specific malicious intent. The prosecution must demonstrate that the official acted not to enforce general law, but specifically to break a lawful political stalemate.

4. **Liability:** The official who gives the order bears ultimate responsibility. Officials who carry out the order may be prosecuted as accomplices if they knowingly participate in the unlawful scheme, all punishable by up to life in prison with no possibility of parole or pardon.

### Section 6: Crime of Malicious Prosecution

Any official who knowingly initiates a disqualification proceeding in bad faith, with intent to suppress lawful political opposition, shall be permanently barred from office, forfeit all deferred compensation, and be liable for treble damages to the accused.

## ARTICLE XIV: THE DEFENSE FORCE & MILITARY EFFECTIVENESS

### Section 1: Establishment and Mandate

1. The Defense Force of the Secular Democratic Republic is hereby established as the sole armed service, subordinate to civilian authority as outlined in Article IV.

2. Its mandate is the preservation of the State, the defense of its territory, and the execution of lawful orders from the civilian government.

3. Recognizing that the requirements of discipline, unity, and operational effectiveness in combat are incompatible with the full exercise of certain civilian rights, the provisions of this Article shall constitute a necessary and lawful exception to the rights enumerated in Article I for all persons in the Defense Force.

### Section 2: Suspension of Rights During Service

Upon voluntary enlistment or conscription, and for the duration of their service, members of the Defense Force shall be subject to the following modifications of their constitutional rights:

1. **Modification of Free Expression:**

 - The right to criticize command decisions, strategy, or the political leadership in a public forum is suspended. Speech that undermines unit cohesion, discipline, or morale is prohibited and subject to court-martial.
 - There shall be no right to press access for embedded journalists without command authorization. All military communications are subject to monitoring and censorship for operational security.

2. **Suspension of Digital Privacy:**

 - There shall be no expectation of privacy in personal digital data, communications, or online activity while using government systems or networks, or when such activity is conducted on-base.
 - Bulk data collection of personnel communications for the purposes of force protection and counter-intelligence is expressly permitted.

3. **Modification of the Right to Bear Arms:**

 - The individual right to personally select, acquire, and possess arms is suspended. The bearing of arms is a duty, not a right, and is strictly controlled by the chain of command. Weapons are the property of the State, issued for specific duties and missions.

4. **Suspension of Domestic Privacy:**

 - The right to privacy within one's lawful residence is suspended for on-base housing. Quarters are subject to inspection at any time, with or without cause, by order of a commissioned or non-commissioned officer to ensure discipline, safety, and readiness.

5. **Conditional Suspension of Bodily Autonomy:**

 - The absolute prohibition on mandated medical treatment is suspended. Members may be required to receive vaccinations, prophylactic medications, and other medical treatments deemed necessary for force health protection and operational readiness by the Surgeon General.
 - The right to refuse an order based on a medical mandate is not recognized and is grounds for court-martial.

### Section 3: The Military Justice System

1. A separate system of military courts, known as courts-martial, shall be established to enforce the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

2. **Rights within this system are modified:**

 - The right to a trial by a jury of one's peers is replaced by the right to a court-martial panel composed of commissioned officers and/or senior non-commissioned officers.
 - The right to a speedy trial is retained, but its definition may be adjusted for operational deployments.
 - Protections against self-incrimination are maintained, but the consequences of remaining silent in the face of a direct, lawful order to answer questions are distinct from civilian practice.

### Section 4: Accountability and Restoration of Rights

1. The enhanced penalties for official misconduct apply with greater force to officers of the Defense Force who abuse the authority granted in this Article.

2. All rights suspended or modified under this Article are fully restored upon the member's receipt of an Honorable, General (under honorable conditions), or Other Than Honorable discharge from the Defense Force. A Dishonorable Discharge or a Bad Conduct Discharge shall be considered a waiver of these rights until such time as the individual's civil rights are formally restored by a civilian court.

3. Any member subjected to a court-martial conviction may, upon discharge, petition the civilian Supreme Court for a review of their case on the grounds of a fundamental miscarriage of justice, ensuring a final check by the civilian branch.

### Section 5: Honor, Integrity and Selfless Service

1. All service members are obligated to disobey unlawful orders and ignore unlawful suspensions.

 - This obligation to disobey refers exclusively to orders that a reasonable person, trained in this Constitution, would understand as a direct and manifest violation of the fundamental rights enumerated in Article I or an explicit attempt to subvert the democratic order outlined in Article VII. Disagreement with strategic, tactical, or policy decisions does not constitute grounds for disobedience. The burden of proving the manifest unlawfulness of an order rests with the service member invoking this section.

---

## ARTICLE XV: EDUCATION

### Section 1: The Purpose of Education

The primary purpose of public education in the Secular Democratic Republic is to empower every citizen with the knowledge, skills, and critical faculties necessary for personal flourishing, effective participation in civic life, and the vigilant defense of liberty.

 - **Numeracy & Mathematical Reasoning:** A strong foundation in mathematics, logic, and statistical reasoning necessary for personal finance, technical careers, and evaluating quantitative claims in public discourse.
 - **Basic Physics & Chemistry:** An understanding of how the universe works.
 - **History:** A safeguard that will prevent the same atrocities from repeating themselves, as well as give credit to rightful individuals.

3. Mastery of these foundational skills is the non-negotiable first priority of the education system.

### Section 3: Mandatory Civic and Critical Competency

Upon the foundation of literacy and numeracy, the education system shall mandate instruction in the following, which are **required for graduation**:

### Section 5: The Right to Repair Educational Deficits

1. Recognizing that a failed education is a deprivation of a fundamental right, any adult citizen who did not receive an adequate education as defined in this Article shall have the right to free, state-provided remedial education to achieve functional literacy, numeracy, and civic competency.

---

## ARTICLE XVI: THE RIGHT OF CONSTITUTIONAL RESTORATION

### Section 1: The Ultimate Sovereignty of the People

1. All political power is inherent in the people. The government instituted by this Constitution is a trustee of that power, and its authority is contingent upon its fidelity to this document.

### Section 5: Accountability and Transition

1. **The Provisional Council's sole mandate is to:**

 - Arrest and detain all principal officials of the dissolved government for trial.
 - Secure all government infrastructure and records.

 - All drawn-down amounts restored within 30 days.

2. **Transparency and Audit:**

 - All transactions subject to real-time audit.
 - Public Integrity department oversees auditing.
 - Full public report within 60 days of Funding Lapse end.

3. **Penalty for Misuse:**

 - Immediate dismissal for violators.
 - Permanent disqualification from public office.
 - Criminal prosecution for embezzlement.

### Section 4: Judicial Branch Funding During a Funding Lapse

1. **Principle of Shared Accountability:**

 - No branch of government shall be financially insulated from a failure to perform its core constitutional duties.
 - While judicial independence is paramount, the administration of justice is an essential service that must be protected.

2. **The Judicial Compensation & Operations Fund:**

 - A Judicial Compensation & Operations Fund shall be established for the Supreme Court, separate from the departmental reserve system.
 - This fund shall be pre-funded to cover no less than three (3) months of all judicial operations, including justices' salaries, law clerk salaries, and essential court functions.

3. **Conditional Access and the Mandatory Review Trigger:**

 - Upon the declaration of a Funding Lapse, the Supreme Court shall retain immediate access to its fund.
 - However, access is conditional. The Court shall have a non-delegable duty to expedite and rule on the constitutionality of the Funding Lapse itself within thirty (30) days of its declaration.
 - If the Court fails to issue a ruling within this 30-day period, its access to the Judicial Fund is automatically suspended until a ruling is issued.
 - During suspension, the salaries of the Justices are put on hold, and non-essential court operations may be frozen.

4. **The "Poisoned Well" Provision:**

 - If the Supreme Court's ruling ultimately finds that the Funding Lapse was caused by a legitimate political dispute, salaries are restored retroactively upon the passage of a budget.
 - If the Court's ruling finds that the Funding Lapse was initiated or prolonged by any branch in bad faith or as a subversion of the constitutional order, then:
  * The salaries for the officials in the offending branch(es) are permanently forfeited for the duration of the lapse.
  * The salaries for the Supreme Court Justices are not restored retroactively for the period of the lapse. The Court bears a financial cost for having to adjudicate a crisis caused by the bad faith of other branches.

## ARTICLE XVIII: ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE

1. **Principle of Necessary Function:**

 - The departmental structure exists to faithfully execute the mandates and uphold the rights enshrined in this Constitution.
 - No organizational chart is permanent. The structure of the executive branch shall evolve to meet the challenges of its time.

2. **Mechanism for Creation:**

 - A new Executive Department may be established by a majority vote of the Legislative Congress, provided its founding charter demonstrates a clear necessity to fulfill a constitutional mandate that existing departments cannot adequately address.
 - The proposal must be reviewed for constitutional alignment by the Department of Public Integrity and Accountability and for scientific/technical feasibility by the Scientific Branch before a vote.

3. **Mechanism for Reorganization or Dissolution:**

 - An existing department may be reorganized or dissolved by a joint two-thirds (⅔) majority vote of the Legislative Congress and the Citizens' Assembly.
 - A finding from the Historian Branch on the historical performance and necessity of the department must be presented before such a vote.
 - Under no circumstances can a department be dissolved to abridge or nullify a fundamental right it was created to protect.

4. **The "Sunset and Review" Clause:**

 - Every Executive Department shall be subject to a mandatory comprehensive review every ten (10) years by the Citizens' Assembly.
 - This review shall assess its efficiency, its effectiveness in fulfilling its constitutional mandate, and its continued necessity.
 - The findings of this review may be used to initiate a reorganization or dissolution process.

## ARTICLE XIX: SUBSIDIARITY AND LOCAL AUTONOMY

### Section 1: Principle of Subsidiarity

1. Governance shall be exercised at the most local level competent to address the matter at hand. The Republic recognizes that strong communities require meaningful autonomy.

2. The national government shall exercise only those powers expressly delegated to it by this Constitution. All residual powers of governance reside in the Provinces, Municipalities, and Chartered Communities.

### Section 2: Provincial Charters

1. Upon ratification, the existing administrative divisions of the Republic may, by majority vote of their residents conducted under Article V, adopt a Provincial Charter establishing a distinct system of local governance.

2. Such Charter must be submitted to the Supreme Court for certification that it does not violate, diminish, or evade any right or duty established in Articles I, II, V, VII, XII, XV, XVI, or any other unamendable provision of this Constitution.

3. A certified Charter shall have the force of organic law within that Province. The national government shall not abrogate or suspend it except upon a finding by the Supreme Court, upon petition of the Citizens' Assembly, that the Province has systematically violated the constitutional rights of its residents.

### Section 3: Reserved Powers of Provinces and Municipalities

1. Provinces and Municipalities shall have exclusive authority over:

 - Land use, zoning, and local environmental regulation, provided such regulations comply with Article I, Section 2 and do not function as de facto discrimination against protected classes.
 - Local law enforcement policy and priorities, provided such policies comply with Article I, Section 18 and Article II.
 - Public education curriculum and administration, provided such curricula comply with Article XV, Section 4 and achieve the minimum proficiency standards established by the Scientific Branch.
 - Local revenue systems, including the authority to levy taxes, fees, or other assessments, provided such systems do not duplicate or conflict with national revenue mechanisms necessary to fund the guarantees of Article III.
 - Cultural, artistic, and heritage preservation.
 - The establishment of local sortition bodies, citizens' assemblies, and participatory budgeting processes.

2. This enumeration of powers shall not be construed to deny or disparage other powers retained by the Provinces or the people.

### Section 4: The Non-Waiver of Fundamental Rights

1. No State/Province, Municipality, or Chartered Community shall exercise its reserved powers in a manner that denies, suspends, or abridges any right guaranteed under Article I of this Constitution.

2. A local ordinance that discriminates against a protected class, restricts access to reproductive healthcare, establishes or endorses a religious doctrine, or otherwise violates the unamendable core of this Constitution shall be void ab initio.

3. Any resident of a jurisdiction that has enacted such a void ordinance may bring a cause of action directly in federal court. The offending jurisdiction shall be liable for treble damages and full attorney's fees.

### Section 5: The Civic Apprenticeship

1. Service in a local sortition body, municipal commission, or provincial assembly shall count as prior service for the purpose of the Weighted Sortition system established in Article IV, Section 10.

2. The Republic shall encourage and fund the establishment of local participatory bodies as training grounds for national civic duty.

### Section 6: The Binding Nature of Fundamental Law

1. For the avoidance of doubt, the reservation of powers to Provinces and Municipalities under this Article shall not be construed to imply, confer, or authorize any power to suspend, abridge, or deny any right, protection, or guarantee enumerated in the unamendable articles of this Constitution.

2. The obligations imposed by Articles I, II, V, VII, XII, XV, and XVI apply with full force and effect to every level of governance within the Republic. No jurisdictional boundary, charter provision, or local ordinance may operate as a bar to their enforcement.

3. Any public official who knowingly votes for, signs, or enforces an ordinance in violation of this Section shall be personally subject to the penalties enumerated in Article II, Section 3 and Article XII, Section 1.

4. **Automatic Sunset:**

All measures implemented in response to a declared public health emergency shall expire automatically after 30 days unless renewed by the Public Health Council based on current evidence. The Council must publish its justification for any renewal.

## FINAL DECLARATION

This Constitution establishes a framework balancing individual liberty with social responsibility, ensuring both freedom and dignity for all persons while protecting the common good. The large size of our sortition-based branches ensures that the people's representatives can travel, investigate, and hold power accountable wherever it is exercised. The Poisoned Chalice and deferred compensation ensure that those who seek public office do so for the right reasons. The seven branches ensure that no single center of power can dominate the others. The right of constitutional restoration ensures that if all else fails, the people retain the ultimate power to begin again.

We affirm that human dignity is inviolable. We affirm that the power to punish is not the power to torture. We affirm that the power to confine is not the power to degrade. We draw lines that no official may cross, in any emergency, for any reason. On this, there is no compromise.

Let every vote count. Let every voice be heard. Let every person belong. Let every conscience be free. Let every barrier fall. Let us build a society where everyone can participate, where everyone belongs, where everyone is protected, and where everyone is restored.

Let this Constitution be our shield and our guide, now and for generations to come.

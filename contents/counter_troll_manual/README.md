# Discourse Analysis Framework

## Project Overview

This repository contains academic materials and analytical frameworks for studying rhetorical patterns in online discourse. These resources are designed for scholarly research and educational applications in digital communication and media literacy.

## Purpose & Methodology

Your mission is to create comprehensive textbook analysis and model foreseeable debates based on the foundational work in files like `article_1-banned_from_gynecology.md`. This document provides the legal and rhetorical framework—your task is to adapt these analytical strategies to understand disinformation patterns and rhetorical tactics.

Use DeepSeek (preferred) or similar language model. Show it the structure of the provided files, and it should give you Markdown code for you to copy and paste. 

The toolbox folder in previous directories will provide base HTML code to simulate website. They are not intended to be functioning, full fledged websites. 

### Key Analytical Principles

- **Document Patterns**: Analyze screenshots of interactions to identify recurring rhetorical strategies and disinformation patterns.
- **Adapt and Evolve**: Create new analytical frameworks in the `manual/` folder while maintaining the scholarly rigor demonstrated in the `textbook/` examples.
- **Leverage the Academic Ecosystem**: The copyleft nature of this project means others may build upon it, creating opportunities for collaborative research and improved analytical models.

## Technical Context

While AI tools are widely available, they cannot replicate the deep contextual understanding and analytical nuance developed through rigorous study of these materials. This creates sustainable value for trained analysts.

## Mindset & Approach

> "This is academic analysis of discourse patterns, not personal engagement."

Approach this work with scholarly discipline. Focus on:
- Understanding informational ecosystems
- Educating about rhetorical patterns
- Maintaining academic objectivity in all analysis

## Compliance & Ethical Use

This repository contains materials for **academic analysis and education only**. The frameworks presented are designed for:
- Understanding rhetorical fallacies and disinformation tactics.
- Scholarly research into online communication patterns.
- Developing critical media literacy skills.

**Strictly Prohibited Uses:**
- Harassment or coordination of harassment against any individual or group.
- Doxxing (revealing private information) or inciting others to do so.
- Any action that violates Codeberg's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

Engaging with rhetorical patterns is analyzed here as an intellectual exercise, not an operational directive.

## License & Compliance

This project operates under strict adherence to platform terms of service. All derivative works must maintain:
- Respect for individual privacy
- Avoidance of harassment
- Focus on rhetorical patterns and ideas, not individuals
- Academic discourse standards
